       "\"A fine of 1000 BGN (or roughly 500 EUR) was imposed on a bank for calling a client for the unresolved bills of his neighbor. This provoked the client to evoke his right to be forgotten. After not receiving any answer from the bank he filed another motion, for which the bank did take action in the statutory period. Nonetheless, the client filed a complaint to KZLD. The infringement for which the bank was fined was for the processing of the client’s personal data was not linked to his consumer credit agreement. Since the purpose for which the data were processed was different from that communicated at the time of conclusion of the contract, the bank had, in the point of view of KZLD, to request additional consent from its client. Repeated registration of prepaid services without the knowledge and consent of the data subject Employees of the telecommunications provider have used personal data and registered the complainant with the company's prepaid service. The data subject had not signed the application and had not consented to the processing of his personal data for the stated purpose. There was also no other legal basis applicable. The signature of the application and the complainant own genuine application were not identical and the persons personal identification number was indicated, but the identity card number was not the complainants one. A bank gained personal data concernign a student wihtout a legal basis. A patient complained to the Commissioner that the request for access to her medical file was not satisfied by the hospital because the dossier could not be identified/located by the controller. After investigating the case, an administrative fine of €5,000 was imposed on the hospital. Data was not processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures ('integrity and confidentiality'). Data was not processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures ('integrity and confidentiality'). Data was not only processed if adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed ('data minimisation') and not only kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed ('storage limitation'). \\xa0The Danish DPA\\xa0reported the taxi company to the police and recommended\\xa0a fine (of 1.2M DKK) for non-adherence to the data-minimization principle. While the company deleted the names of its passengers from all its records after two years, the deletion did not include the rest of the ride records (about 8,873,333 taxi trips). Hence, the company continued to hold onto individual's phone numbers.\\xa0 Please note: Since Danish law does not provide for administrative fines as in the GDPR (unless it is an uncomplicated case and the accused person consented), fines will be imposed by courts. On June 3, 2019, the Danish DPA (Datatilsynet) reported IDdesign to the police and demanded payment of a fine in the amount of EUR 200,850 for the processing of personal data of approximately 385,000 customers for a longer period than necessary for the purposes for which they were processed. Additionally, the company had not established and documented deadlines for deletion of personal data in their new CRM system. The deadlines set for the old system were not deleted after the deadline for the information had been reached. Also, the controller had not adequately documented its personal data deletion procedures. Please note: Since Danish law does not provide for administrative fines as in the GDPR (unless it is an uncomplicated case and the accused person consented), fines will be imposed by courts. Update: On February 12, 2021 the Aarhus District Court decided to impose a fine against IDdesign in the amount of EUR 13,450. With regard to the calculation of the fine, the court disagreed with the proposed amount of the fine. It concluded that the amount should be calculated on the basis of the company's own turnover and not that of the entire group. In addition, the court considered that the mitigating circumstances under Art. 83 (2) GDPR should be taken into account when calculating the fine. Such as that the company had not previously breached the GDPR, as well as that the breach concerned only general personal data. In addition, no data subject suffered damages as a result of the breach. Finally, the court considers that the negligent nature of the breach should be taken into account. The CNIL based the penalty on two grounds: Lack of basic security measures and excessive data storage. As to the first, sensitive user documents uploaded by rental candidates (including ID cards, health cards, tax notices, certificates issued by the family allowance fund, divorce judgments, account statements) were accessible online without any authentication procedure in place. Although the vulnerability was known to the company since March 2018, it was not finally resolved until September 2018. In addition, the company stored the documentation provided by candidates for longer than necessary. The CNIL took into account i.a. the seriousness of the breach (lack of due care in addressing vulnerability and the fact that the documents revealed very intimate aspects of users' lives), the size of the company and its financial standing. After a hacker attack in July personal data of approx. 330.000 users, including passwords and email addresses had been revealed. Illegal disclosure of personal data relating to a third party. A bank mistakenly sent SMS messages about a subject's credit card debt to the telephone number of another person. After receiving an incorrect telephone number from the client at the time of contracting, the bank did not comply with the data subject's request to erase the data and continued to send SMS message to the incorrect telephone number. The fine represents 0.0016% of the annual profit of the bank. The fine was imposed on the Mayor’s Office of the city of Kecskemét for unlawful disclosure of the personal information of a whistleblower.NAIH imposed the fine after an employee of an organisation that it supervised reported a public interest complaint directly to it against his employer. After the organisation learned of the complaint, it requested details in order to investigate, and the local government accidentally revealed the complainant's name. The NAIH considered it an aggravating factor that as a result of the data breach, the organisation fired the person who made the report. NAIH imposed a fine of HUF 11,000,000 (EUR 34,375) on an undisclosed Hungarian political party for failing to notify the NAIH and relevant individuals about a data breach, and failing to document the breach according to GDPR Article 33.5. As mandated by law, the fine was based on 4% of the party's annual turnover and 2.65 % of its anticipated turnover for the coming year. The breach was the result of a cyber attack by an anonymous hacker who accessed and disclosed information on the vulnerability of the organisation’s system – a database of more than 6,000 individuals – and the command used for the attack. The system was vulnerable to attack because of a redirection problem with the organisation's webpage. After the attacker published the command, even people with low IT knowledge were able to retrieve information from the database. A number of websites affiliated to the Italian political party Movimento 5 Stelle are run, by means of a data processor, through the platform named Rousseau. The platform had suffered a data breach during the summer 2017 that led the Italian data protection authority, the Garante, to require the implementation of a number of security measures, in addition to the obligation to update the privacy information notice in order to give additional transparency to the data processing activities performed.While the update of the privacy information notice was timely completed, the Italian data protection authority, raised its concerns as to the lack of implementation on the Rousseau platform of some of GDPR related security measures. It is worth it to mention that the proceeding initiated before May 2018, but the Italian data protection authority issued a fine under the GDPR since the Rousseau platform had not adopted security measures required by means of an order issued after the 25th of May 2018. Interestingly, the fine was not issued against the Movimento 5 Stelle that is the data controller of the platform, but against the Rousseau association that is the data processor. During an inspection, the Lithuanian Data Protection Supervisory Authority found that the controller processed more data than necessary to achieve the purposes for which he was a controller. In addition, it became known that from 09 - 10 July 2018 payment data were publicly available on the internet due to inadequate technical and organisational measures. 9,000 payments with 12 banks from different countries were affected. According to the supervisory authority, a data breach notification pursuant to Art. 33 GDPR would have been necessary. The controller did not report the Data Breach. As a result of the lack of appropriate security measures on the Lands Authority website, over 10 gigabytes of personal data became easily accessible to the public via a simple google search. The majority of the leaked data contained highly-sensitive information and correspondence between individuals and the Authority itself. The Lands Authority chose not to appeal. In Malta, in the case of a breach by a public authority or body, the Data Protection Commissioner may impose an administrative fine of up to €25,000 for each violation and may additionally impose a daily fine of €25 for each day such violation persists. The incident relates to computer files with usernames and passwords to over 35000 user accounts in the municipality’s computer system. The user accounts related to both pupils in the municipality’s primary schools, and to the employees of the same schools. Due to insufficient security measures, these files have been unprotected and openly accessible. The lack of security measures in the system made it possible for anyone to log in to the school’s various information systems, and thereby to access various categories of personal data relating to the pupils and employees of the schools. The fact that the security breach encompasses personal data to over 35 000 individuals, and that the majority of these are children, were considered to be aggravating factors. The municipality had also been warned several times, both by the authority and an internal whistleblower, that the data security was inadequate. The fine concerned the proceedings related to the activity of a company which processed the data subjects’ data obtained from publicly available sources, inter alia from the Central Electronic Register and Information on Economic Activity, and processed the data for commercial purposes. The authority verified incompliance with the information obligation in relation to natural persons conducting business activity – entrepreneurs who are currently conducting such activity or have suspended it, as well as entrepreneurs who conducted such activity in the past. The controller fulfilled the information obligation by providing the information required under Art. 14 (1) – (3) of the GDPR only in relation to the persons whose e-mail addresses it had at its disposal. In case of the remaining persons the controller failed to comply with the information obligation – as it explained in the course of the proceedings – due to high operational costs. Therefore, it presented the information clause only on its website. According to the UODO this is not sufficient. Addendum: In the meantime, the court has cancelled the fine due to procedural errors. The amount of the fine has to be determined by the concrete number of data records concerned. However, the Office had not submitted any verifiable evidence in this regard, but had simply assumed that 6 million data sets were involved, which the data controller had denied. Therefore, important statements were missing. In particular, it was incorrect to justify the amount of the fine on the basis of general preventive considerations. Art. 58 GDPR expressly states that a fine imposed must be related to the specific facts of the case. The Polish data protection authority has already announced that the fine will be revised in a new administrative procedure. One sports association published personal data referring to judges who were granted judicial licenses online. However, not only their names were provided, but also their exact addresses and PESEL numbers. Meanwhile, there is no legal basis for such a wide range of data on judges to be available on the Internet. By making them public, the administrator posed a potential risk of their unauthorized use, e.g. to impersonate them for the purpose of borrowing or other obligations. Although the association itself noticed its own error, as evidenced by the notification of a personal data protection breach to the President of the PDPA, the fact that attempts to remove it were ineffective determined the imposition of a penalty. When determining the amount of the fine (PLN 55,750.50), the President of UODO also took into account, among others, the duration of the infringement and the fact that it concerned a large group of persons (585 judges). It concluded that although the infringement was finally removed, it was of a serious nature.However, when imposing a penalty, the President of the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection also took into account mitigating circumstances, such as good cooperation between the controller and the supervisory authority or lack of evidence that damage had been caused to the persons whose data had been disclosed. Investigation revealed that the hospital’s staff, psychologists, dietitians and other professionals had access to patient data through false profiles. The profile management system appeared deficient – the hospital had 985 registered doctor profiles while only having 296 doctors. Moreover, doctors had unrestricted access to all patient files, regardless of the doctor’s specialty. The spanish telecommunications and informations agancy (SETSI) decided Vodafone had to reimburse a customer for costs he was wrongfully charged for. Nevertheless, Vodafone reported personal data of this respective customer to a solvency registry (BADEXCUG). The AEPD found this behaviour violated the principle of accuracy. The national Football League (LaLiga) was fined for offering an app which once per minute accessed the microphone of users' mobile phones in order to detect pubs screening football matches without paying a fee. In the opinion of the AEPD LaLiga did not adequately inform the users of the app about this practice. Furthermore, the app did not meet the requirements for withdrawal of consent. After the claimant did alledgedly not pay back a microcredit to an online credit agany, the claim was assigned to the debt collecting agancy. Subsequently, the latter startet sending emails not only to email addresses provided by the claimant but also to an institutional email address of his workplace accessible by any co-worker which was never provided by the claimant. Although the complainant (a former Vodafone customer) had requested Vodafone to delete his data in 2015 and this request had been confirmed by the company, he received more than 200 SMS from the company from 2018 onwards. Following Vodafone's statement, this happened because the complainant's mobile phone number was erroneously used for testing purposes and accidentally appeared in various customer files belonging to other customers than the complainant. Since the company agreed to both payment and admission of responsibility the fine was reduced in accordance with Spanish administrative law to EUR 27k. The data controller did not fulfil the data subject's access request. \\xa0The fine was issued as a result of the failure to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures (related to (1) the determination of the processing means/operations, and (2) the integration the necessary safeguards) resulting in the online-disclosure of IDs and addresses (interla/external transactions) of 337,042 data subjects to their respective beneficiary (between 25.05.2018 -10.12.2018). In July 2019, the ICO issued a notice of its intention to fine British Airways £183.39M for GDPR infringements which likely involve a breach of Art. 32 GDPR. The proposed fine relates to a cyber incident notified to the ICO by British Airways in September 2018. This incident in part involved user traffic to the British Airways website being diverted to a fraudulent site. Through this false site, customer details were harvested by the attackers. Personal data of approximately 500,000 customers were compromised in this incident, which is believed to have begun in June 2018. The ICO’s investigation has found that a variety of information was compromised by poor security arrangements at the company, including log in, payment card, and travel booking details as well name and address information. In the meantime, the final fine imposed on the airline has been set at £20 million (approximately EUR 22,046,000). The ICO emphasized that when setting the amount of the fine, it also took into account the economic impact of the COVID-19 ('Coronavirus') pandemic on the airline industry. Original Summary: The ICO issued a notice of its intention to fine Marriott International Inc due to a cyber incident which was notified to the ICO by Marriott in November 2018. A variety of personal data contained in approximately 339 million guest records globally were exposed by the incident, of which around 30 million related to residents of 31 countries in the European Economic Area (EEA). Seven million related to UK residents. It is believed the vulnerability began when the systems of the Starwood hotels group were compromised in 2014. Marriott subsequently acquired Starwood in 2016, but the exposure of customer information was not discovered until 2018. The ICO’s investigation found that Marriott failed to undertake sufficient due diligence when it bought Starwood and should also have done more to secure its systems. --> Update: On 2020/10/30, the ICO announced its final decision to impose a fine of £ 18.4 million (approximately EUR 20.4 million) on Marriott International Inc. In its decision, the ICO set forth its considerations for the calculation of the fine, which included Marriott's absence of prior violations or omissions and the fact that Marriott had fully cooperated with the investigation and had taken steps to notify the individuals concerned. In addition, the ICO noted that it had also made an alignment with other fines already imposed on other companies - in particular also of other European data protection authorities. The fine was imposed because adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing were not implemented. This has led to unauthorized disclosure and unauthorized access to the personal data of people who have made transactions received by the avocatoo.ro website (name, surname, mailing address, email, phone, job, details of transactions made), due to publicly accessible documents between 10th of December 2018 and 1st of February 2019. The National Supervisory Authority applied the sanction following a notification dated 12th of October 2018 indicating that a set of files regarding the details of the transactions received by the avocatoo.ro website which contained the name, surname, address correspondence, email, telephone, job and details of transactions made, was publicly accessible through two links. The Haga Hospital does not have a proper internal security of patient records in place. This is the conclusion of an investigation by the Dutch Data Protection Authority. This investigation followed when it appeared that dozens of hospital staff had unnecessarily checked the medical records of a well-known Dutch person. To force the hospital to improve the security of patient records, the AP simultaneously imposes an order subject to a penalty. If the Haga Hospital has not improved security before 2nd of October 2019, the hospital must pay 100,000 EUR every two weeks, with a maximum of 300,000 EUR. The Haga Hospital has meanwhile indicated to take measures. Large amount of customer accounts, clients' documents (including copies of driver's licences, vehicle registration, bank statements and documents to determine whether a person had been the subject of a licence withdrawal) and data were easily accesible online. The CNIL, between others, critizised the password management (unauthorized access was possible without any authentication). A school in Skellefteå made a trial to use facial recognition technology. The fine was imposed against the school which had used facial recognition technology to monitor the attendance of students. Even though, in general, data processing for the purpose of monitoring attendance is possible doing so with facial recognition is disproportioned to the goal to monitor attendance. The supervisory authority is of the opinion that biometric data of students was processed which is why Art. 9 GDPR is applicable. Additionally, the authority argued that consent can not be applied since students and their guardians cannot freely decide if they/their children want to be monitored for attendance purposes. When examining if the school board can rely on any of the exemptions listed in Art. 9 (2), the supervisory authority found that this was not the case. The supervisory authority also found that there was a case of a processing activity with high risks since new technology was used to process sensitive personal data concerning children who are in a dependency position to the high school board and due to camera surveillance being used in the students everyday environment. In the view of the authority, the school board was not able to demonstrate compliance with Art. 35 GDPR and that the school board was required to consult the authority in accordance with Art. 36 (1) GDPR. A\\xa0consumer claimed that AVON COSMETICS had unlawfully processed his data without adequately verifying his identity, which led to his data being erroneously entered in a register of claims, preventing him from working with his bank. As a result, a third party fraudulently used the consumers personal data. Leakage of personal data in a hacking attack due to inadequate technical and organisational measures to ensure the protection of information security. It was found that\\xa0personal data\\xa0concerning about 6 million persons was illegally accessible. \\xa0Leakage of personal data due to inadequate technical and organisational measures to ensure the protection of information security. Third parties had access to over 23000 credit records relating to over 33000 bank customers including personal data such as names, citizenships, identification numbers, adresses, copies of identity cards and biometric data. The data controller did not fulfil its data breach notification obligations when a flash memory with personal data was lost. Fine for security vulnerabilities in a mobile messaging app developed for use in an Oslo school. The app allows parents and students to send messages to school staff. Due to insufficient technical and organizational measures to protect information security, unauthorized persons were able to log in as authorized users and gain access to personal data about students, legal representatives and employees. The fine has meanwhile been reduced to EUR 120.000 Denial of the right to access recorded phone calls by the Data Subject \\xa0The Polish data protection authority imposed a fine of over PLN 2.8 million (approx. €644,780) on Morele.net for insufficient organisational and technical safeguards, which led to unauthorised access to the personal data of 2.2 million people. The Belgian data protection authority has imposed a fine of 10,000 euros on a merchant who wanted to use an electronic identity card (eID) to create a customer card. The DPA's investigation revealed that\\xa0the merchant required access to personal data located on the eID, including the\\xa0photo and barcode which is linked to the data subject's identification number. In the meantime, the decision of the data protection authority has been annulled by a court A large number of customers were subject to telemarketing calls, although they had declared an opt-out for this. This was ignored due to technical errors. Inappropriate technical measures resulted in the data of 8,000 customers not being deleted upon request. Raiffeisen Bank Romania carried out scoring assessments on the basis of personal data of individuals registered on the Vreau Credit platform provided by the platform's staff via WhatsApp and then returned the result to Vreau Credit using the same means of communication. Raiffeisen Bank Romania carried out scoring assessments on the basis of personal data of individuals registered on the Vreau Credit platform provided by the platform's staff via WhatsApp and then returned the result to Vreau Credit using the same means of communication. The Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD) has sanctioned Vueling Airlines with 30,000 euros for not giving users the ability to refuse their cookies and force them to use them if they want to browse its website. In other words, it was not possible to browse the Vueling page without accepting their cookies. AEDP issued a sanctioning resolution for the amount of 30,000 euros, which could be reduced to 18,000 for immediate payment. A patient complained to the Commissioner that the request for access to her medical file was not satisfied by the hospital because the dossier could not be identified/located by the controller. After investigating the case, an administrative fine of €5,000 was imposed on the hospital. As part of the registration process on the webseite avocatnet.ro, the operator used an unfilled checkbox, by means of which users could declare that they did not wish to receive information letters via e-mail (opt-out). Without any action, the user was automatically sent information letters via e-mail. This did not fulfil the requirements for a GDPR-compliant consent. Originally, a fine in the amount of EUR 14.500.000 was issued against Deutsche Wohnen SE for using an archiving system for the storage of personal data of tenants that, according to the data protection authority, did not provide for the possibility of removing data that was no longer required. According to the data protection authority, personal data of tenants were stored without checking whether storage was permissible or even necessary and it was therefore possible to access personal data of affected tenants which had been stored for years without this data still serving the purpose of its original collection. This involved data on the personal and financial circumstances of tenants, such as salary statements, self-disclosure forms, extracts from employment and training contracts, tax, social security and health insurance data as well as bank statements. In addition to sanctioning this structural violation, the Berlin data protection commissioner imposed further fines of between 6,000 and 17,000 euros on the company for the inadmissible storage of personal data of tenants in 15 specific individual cases. See the separate entry. *** UPDATE *** On 24 February 2021 the Berlin Regional Court has dismissed the fine against Deutsche Wohnen SE due to procedural errors In addition to sanctioning violations of privacy by design principles (Art. 5 GDPR, Art. 25 GDPR - see separate entry), the Berlin data protection commissioner imposed further fines of between 6,000 and 17,000 euros on the company for the inadmissible storage of personal data of tenants in 15 specific individual cases. In a digital publication, health data was accidentally published due to inadequate internal control mechanisms. The UODO imposed a fine of EUR 47000 for obstructing the exercise of the right of withdrawal for the processing of personal data. The company has not taken appropriate technical and organisational measures that allow the simple and effective withdrawal of consent to the processing of personal data and the exercise of the right to request the erasure of personal data. TODOTECNICOS24H had collected personal data without providing accurate information about data collection in its data protection declaration pursuant to Article 13 of the GDPR. The gas company did not have appropriate measures in place to verify the identity of the data subject. The person who filed the complaint alleges that the company e-mailed his information to a third party in response to a request. The company had collected personal data without providing accurate information about data collection in its data protection declaration pursuant to Article 13 of the GDPR As the UWV (the Dutch employee insurance service provider - 'Uitvoeringsinstituut Werknemersverzekeringen') did not use multi-factor authentication when accessing the online employer portal, security was inadequate. Employers and health and safety services were able to collect and display health data from employees in an absence system. The operator of an online game was exposed to several DDoS attacks which caused the malfunctioning of the servers. The attacker blackmailed the operator stating that the attacks will not stop unless he pays money. As part of the blackmail, the attacker offered the operator that he will create an upgraded and better firewall protection to the servers of the operator. The operator agreed and paid the attacker. The operator implemented the new code from the attacker which proved better than the old one but there was a 'backdoor' in the code. The attacker used the backdoor to steal all the data from the server about the players and uploaded these details to his website. The Office for Personal Data Protection concluded that the operator did not take apropriate security measures. The fine was imposed because the controller failed to take appropriate technical and organisational measures leading to the loss and unauthorised access to personal data (name, bank card number, CVV code, cardholder's address, personal identification number, serial and identity card number, bank account number, authorised credit limit) of approximately 1,100 data subjects. An individual complainant had received an SMS from Xfera Móviles which was to be addressed to a third party and which allowed him to access the account and personal data of this third party on the Xfera Móviles website via the telephone number and password received by SMS. Unlawful data processing. No further information available yet. The company installed cookies on an end users terminal device without prior consent of the data subject. The fine is based on several breaches of the GDPR in connection with a patient mix-up at the admission of the patient. This resulted in incorrect invoicing and revealed structural technical and organisational deficits in the hospital's patient management. \\xa0The Romanian data protection authority imposed a sanction on an airline because it has not taken appropriate measures to ensure that any natural person acting under its supervision processes personal data in accordance with its instructions (Article 32(4) of the GDPR). This resulted in an employee having unauthorized access to the booking application and being able to photograph a list with the personal data of 22 passengers/customers to disclose this list on the Internet.  ING Bank has not taken appropriate technical and organisational measures for an automated data processing system during the settlement process of card transactions affecting 225,525 customers, resulting in double transactions being executed between 8 and 10 October. Royal President refused a request for access to personal data pursuant to Article 15 of the GDPR and disclosed personal data without the consent of the data subjects. In addition, Royal President has not taken appropriate technical or organisational measures to ensure the security of the data processed. Original Fine Summary: The Controller is a company offering telecommunication services. A caller could obtain extensive information on personal customer data from the company's customer service department simply by entering a customer's name and date of birth. In this authentication procedure, the BfDI aws a violation of Article 32 GDPR, according to which a company is obliged to take appropriate technical and organisational measures to systematically protect the processing of personal data. Due to the company's cooperation with the data protection authority, the fine imposed was at the lower end of the scale. -- Update: On November 11th, 2020, after an appeal against the fine, the Bonn District Court decided that although the fine is justified in principle, it is unreasonably high. The chamber has therefore reduced the fine from originally EUR 9,55 million to EUR 900,000. One of the reasons for the reduction was that the company's procedure for authenticating customers used for its telephone hotline (requesting only the name and date of birth of the caller) had remained unobjected for a long time and therefore the company lacked a concrete awareness of the problem which leads to the fact that the concrete culpability in this case had to be classified as rather low. Furthermore, according to the court, the violation was also rather minor, as it could not lead to a massive data leakage. Vodafone had processed personal data of the claimant (bank details, name, surname and national identification number) years after the contractual relationsid had ended. The fine of EUR 35.000 was reduced to EUR 21.000. The company sent a marketing email to a large number of recipients (clients) without using the blind copy feature. The initial fine of EUR 60.000 was reduced to EUR 36.000. Customers could access personal data of other customers in the customer area. The initial fine of EUR 60.000 was reduced to EUR 48.000. \\xa0The claimant's bank account was charged by the company with two invoices for the services he had contracted, however, displaying personal data of another customer. The initial fine of EUR 60.000 was reduced to EUR 48.000. Disclosure of customer personal data (i.a. purchase history) via an SMS to another customer. The initial fine of EUR 50.000 was reduced to EUR 30.000. The company had charged a Netflix service that had not been solicited by the claimant. The claimant could prove that the service had been used by another household which allegedly had received the claimant's bank account and phone number from Vodafone. Since Vodafone could not prove that the claimant had consented to the conclusion of the contract concerning the Netflix services, the AEPD imposed a fine of EUR 40.000. An individual filed a complaint against the company alleging that the company had used its personal data as a former customer, such as first and last name, VAT identification number and address, to enter into an electricity supply contract. \\xa0The company collected personal data without providing accurate information on their data processing activities in their privacy policy published on their website. Nusvar AB, operator of the website Mrkoll.se, which provides information on all Swedes over 16 years of age, had published information on people who are overdue.  A military hospital did not meet the reporting deadline for data breaches. Another part of the fine relates to a lack of technical and organisational measures. Vodafone has sent the customer's invoice data to unauthorised third parties following a customer invoice complaint. Originally, a fine of EUR 75,000 was threatened, but was reduced to EUR 60,000 against immediate payment and waiver of appeal. Vodafone sent an invoice history to the subscriber as part of the invoice complaint by the subscriber. The history also contained invoice data of an unknown third party. Marketing staff had access to patient data. Among other things, this violated the purpose limitation principle. Among other things, the company has ignored objections raised by affected parties against advertising calls. The company has failed to ensure the accuracy of the processing of personal data which resulted in a disclosure of a clients personal data to another client. The association used video surveillance systems without proper information according to Art. 13 GDPR and without adequate security measures regarding the persons having access to the system. An operator of a website for legal news had the privacy statement only available in English, although it was also addressed to a Dutch and French speaking audience. In addition, the first version of the privacy statement was not easily accessible and did not mention the legal basis for data processing under the GDPR. Furthermore, with reference to the ECJ ruling on Planet 49, it was determined that effective consent was required for the use of Google Analytics. A company was fined EUR 294 000 for 'unnecessarily long' storage and retention of personnel files and for 'excessive' data collection in the personnel selection process, during which also\\xa0health data were requested. The sanctions were applied as a result of a complaint alleging that Hora Credit IFN SA transmitted documents containing personal data of another person to a wrong e-mail address. Following the investigation it was found that Hora Credit IFN SA processed the data without providing effective mechanisms for verifying and validating the accuracy of the data collected processed according to the principles set out in art. 5 of the GDPR. It was also found that the operator did not take sufficient security measures for personal data, according to art. 25 and 32 of the GDPR, so as to avoid unauthorized and accessible disclosure of personal data to third parties. At the same time, Hora Credit IFN SA did not notify the Supervisory Authority of the security incident that was brought to its notice, according to art. 33 of the GDPR, within 72 hours from the date it became aware of it. The fine consists of three partial fines of EUR 3000, EUR 10000 and EUR 1000. The sanctions were imposed following a complaint alleging that Enel Energie had unlawfully processed an individual's personal data and was unable to prove that it had obtained the individual's consent to send e-mail notifications. In addition, the ANSPDCP pointed out that the operator had not taken the necessary measures to stop the transmission of notifications, despite the fact that the person had repeatedly exercised his right to object. The operator of SC Enel Energie SRL was sanctioned contraventionally with two fines, each amounting to 14,334.30 lei, the equivalent of the amount of 3000 EUR. Granting the police access to personal data and failing to take adequate measures to secure the data, despite the warnings of the Supervisor, constituted a breach of Article 32 of the GPPR. Sending SMS marketing messages without consent. In particular, no appropriate measures were taken, such as the possibility for telephone users to block marketing messages from the eShop for Sports by opting out of receiving SMS marketing messages. \\xa0The Italian supervisory authority imposed two fines totalling EUR 11,5 million on Eni Gas and Luce (Egl) for unlawful processing of personal data in the context of advertising activities and activation of unsolicited contracts. The first fine of EUR 8.5 million relates to the unlawful processing in connection with telemarketing and telesales activities. Amongst others, promotional calls were made without the consent of the person contacted or despite that person's refusal to receive promotional calls, or without triggering the special procedures for checking the public opt-out register. In addition, there was lack of technical and organisational measures to take account of the information provided by users; data was processed longer than the permitted data retention periods; and data on potential customers was collected from entities (list providers) who had not obtained consent to the disclosure of such data. Companies outside the Aegean Marine Petroleum Group had access to its servers containing personal data and copied the contents of the servers, since Aegean Marine Petroleum failed to take the necessary technical measures to secure the processing of large amounts of data and to keep the relevant software separate from the personal data stored on the servers. Furthermore, Aegean Marine Petroleum had not informed the data subjects of the processing of their personal data stored on the servers. Between January 2017 and 2019, the data protection authority received hundreds of notifications, in particular concerning the receipt of unsolicited commercial communications made without the consent of the data subjects or despite their registration in the public register of objections. Furthermore, irregularities in data processing in connection with competitions were also complained about. In addition, incorrect and non-transparent information on data processing was provided in Apps provided by the Company and invalid methods of consent were used. In some cases, paper forms requesting one single consent were used for various purposes, including marketing. Furthermore, data was kept longer than necessary and thus violated deletion periods. For these violations, the telecommunications company received a fine of EUR 27.8 million. Among other things, the fine was imposed for: lack of consent for marketing activities (telemarketing and cold calling), addressing of data subjects who asked not to be contacted with marketing offers, invalid consents collected in TIM apps, lack of appropriate security measures to protect personal data (including incorrect exchange of blacklists with call centres), lack of clear data retention periods. The supervisory authority also imposed 20 corrective measures on TIM, prohibiting the use of personal data for marketing purposes from those who had refused to receive promotional calls from the call centres. The company had set up an applicant portal on its website where interested parties could submit their application documents online. However, the company did not offer an encrypted transmission of the data, nor did it store the applicant data in an encrypted or password-protected manner. In addition, the unsecured applicant data was linked to Google, so that anyone searching for the respective applicant names on Google could find their application documents and retrieve them without access restrictions. \\xa0Iberia continued to send e-mails to the data subject, despite the data subject had requested the withdrawal of his consent and the erasure of his personal data and that the execution of these measures had already been confirmed to him. \\xa0The data subject, a former customer of the company, continued to receive invoice notifications, although at that time there was neither a contractual relationship nor any payment overdue from the expired contractual relationship. As a reason for the incorrect mailings Vodafone indicated a technical error. \\xa0The complainant had access to third party data in his personal Vodafone profile. The AEPD found that a third party had access to the name, telephone number and address of another customer. \\xa0The fine was preceded by access to health data by unauthorised persons, allowing a trainee and a radiologist to gain access to the health data of their colleagues. The investigations revealed that the technical and organisational measures taken by the hospital to protect health data had proved to be insufficient to ensure adequate protection of patients' personal data, resulting in unlawful data processing. According to the data protection authority, the breach could have been avoided if the hospital had simply followed the guidelines for health records issued by the data protection authority in 2015, which stipulate that access to health records must be restricted only to health personnel involved in patient care. The fine is based on the fact that, according to the data protection authority, the Sapienza Università made available online identification data of two people who had reported possible illegal behaviour to the university. This was due to the lack of adequate technical access control measures within the whisleblowing management system, which had not limited access to such data to authorized personnel only. Vodafone España was unable to prove to the data protection authority that the data subject had given his consent to the processing of his personal data for the provision of a telephone contract. Furthermore, the decision of the data protection authority emphasises that Vodafone España also unlawfully disclosed the personal data of the data subject to various credit agencies. The company had sent the payroll of an employee to another employee and therefore disclosed personal data to an unauthorised party. The corporate website did not present a privacy policy or a cookie banner on its main page. According to the AEPD, the company had not been able to demonstrate adequate measures to ensure information security, leading to unauthorized access to personal data of a client. Original summary: A school in Gdansk used biometric fingerprint scanners to authenticate students for the payment process in the school canteen.

Original Fine Summary: The Swedish data protection authority has fined Google LLC € 7 million for failing to adequately comply with its obligations regarding the right of data subjects to have search results removed from the results list. Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten had already completed a review in 2017 of the way in which Google deals with the right of individuals to have search results removed from Google's search engine and that Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten had instructed Google to remove a number of search results. In addition, data inspections stated that it had initiated a further review of Google's practices in 2018 after it received indications that several of the results that should have been removed still appeared in search results. Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten also objected to Google's current practice of informing web site owners about which results Google is removing from search results, specifically which link has been removed and who is behind the request for removal from the list, as this is without legal basis. Update: On November 23th, 2020, after an appeal against the fine, the The Administrative Court of Stockholm announced that it had rejected Google LLC´s appeal. However the court reduced the fine from a total of SEK 75 million (approx. EUR 7 million) to SEK 52 million (approx. EUR 5 million). On February 26, 2020, the Norwegian DPA (Datatilsynet) announced that it intents to fine Rælingen Municipality EUR 73,600 for violations of Art. 5 (1) f) GDPR and Art. 32 GDPR . This fine has been imposed in the meantime, see details at link Vodafone Romania had incorrectly processed personal data of an individual in order to process a complaint, which was subsequently sent to a wrong e-mail address. The reason for this was that there were insufficient security measures in place to prevent such erroneous data processing. The Decision clarified that data subjects have a right of access to the processing of their personal data and that they must also be provided with a copy of the personal data processed. No reasons need to be given for the request. Customer of a local bank requested access to telephone conversation recordings as well as to CCTV recordings. The bank provided the copies of the recordings of telephone conversations and also provided the chance of reviewing the recordings at bank but rejected to provide copies of the CCTV recordings since the recordings also contained third parties personal data. The NAIH decided in this case that the bank failed to fulfil data subjects rights since it did not respond in due time and also failed to provide copies of the requested recordings. According to the NAIH, the controller could not refer the protection of third party data since the CCTV recordings affected public space open for every customer and the bank also could have anonymised certain parts of the recordings. An ex-employee complained that his employer unlawfully monitored his work by its CCTV. The employer argued that CCTV monitoring was necessary to assess, whether the employee fulfilled his employment related duties (i.e. monitoring certain public areas and signalling any unusual event to his colleagues) and that the monitoring also served the protection of its surveillance system from unlawful access or usage. NAIH found that monitoring of the employee by CCTV is not an appropriate way of assessing his work performance and the employer relied on an inappropriate legal basis (public interest, official authority) regarding the CCTV operations. The employer could have protected its public area surveillance system by other methods (e.g. by installing firewalls or other security upgrades to its systems). The employer also placed only a brief notice sheet at the entrance of the workstation of the employee regarding the CCTV monitoring, which NAIH deemed insufficient. \\xa0The owners of a real estate complained that the government office posted its decision on the change in the person of the lessee (which concluded a lease agreement with real estate owners) to other owners of 40 real estates contracted by the same lessee.

In addition to the fine, the Commission for Personal Data Protection (“KZLD”) instructed L.E. EOOD to do regular inspections of its data processing activities, to do risk analysis regarding customers and employees and to conduct periodic trainings of the employees. The KZLD also ordered L.E. EOOD to archive and keep the documents containing the personal data only for limited purposes and the timeframe as required by law.

This led to contracts being concluded by telephone on behalf of other data subjects From 2015 to 2019, AOK Baden-Württemberg (insurance organization) organized competitions on various occasions and collected personal data of the participants, including their contact details and health insurance affiliation. The AOK also wanted to use this data for advertising purposes, provided the participants had given their consent. With the help of technical and organizational measures, including internal guidelines and data protection training, the AOK wanted to ensure that only data of those contest participants who had previously given their effective consent would be used for advertising purposes. However, the measures defined by the AOK did not meet the legal requirements. As a result, the personal data of more than 500 lottery participants were used for advertising purposes without their consent. Immediately after this became known, the AOK Baden-Württemberg stopped all marketing measures in order to thoroughly examine all processes. \\xa0Failure to take adequate measures to prevent unauthorised disclosure of personal data. The fine was preceded by a complaint about the disclosure of personal data of the data subject to another customer by e-mail. The data subject received a notice from a debt collection company demanding payments in connection with Xfera Móviles' services, even though the claimant had not been a customer of Xfera Móviles since September 2017.

For this reason, a fine was imposed on Telekom Romania for violation of Article 32 of the GDPR, and the introduction of effective mechanisms to identify and protect data from unauthorised disclosure and unlawful processing is ordered to ensure compliance with the GDPR. The company had infringed the principles of purpose limitation and storage restriction because its database contained a large amount of customer data which were no longer relevant for the actual purpose of collection and for which no retention period had been set. Furthermore, the NAIH pointed out that the defendant had not taken proportionate measures to reduce the risks in the area of data management and data security, arguing, inter alia, that it had not used encryption mechanisms. Unlawful usage of surveillance cameras. In the decision, the data protection authority stressed that sound recordings have additional privacy implications, especially in a residential building, and that in this case there is nothing to justify sound recording. In addition, the decision orders the housing association to stop the cameras recording staircases and entrances, to stop sound recording and to improve the information on camera surveillance. \\xa0In the context of a municipal election in 2018, the data controller had sent election advertisements to a group of employees of the same municipal administration, unlawfully using a list of contact data to which he had no access. The data protection authority had found that the Lejre Municipal Child and Youth Centre had regularly uploaded minutes of meetings with particularly sensitive and sensitive personal data, including on citizens under 18 years of age, to the Lejre Municipal Personnel Portal, which was accessible to employees of the Lejre Municipality, regardless of whether the employees in question were working with these cases. In addition, the data protection authority denied the failure to comply with the obligation to inform the persons concerned of the data breach.  It was found that Østfold HF Hospital had stored patient data, including sensitive data such as the reason for hospitalisation, during the period 2013-2019 without controlling access to the folders where the data was stored. Datatilsynet therefore decided that the hospital had not taken sufficient technical and organisational measures to protect personal data and was therefore in breach of the GDPR and the Patient Records Act. A third person had received an electricity bill with personal details such as name, address and bank account of another customer. The reason for this was that Iberdola Clientes was not able to guarantee adequate security measures in the processing of the personal data of the data subject, in violation of the principles of data integrity and confidentiality.

The Municipality had failed to carry out a Data Protection Impact Assessment ('DPIA') in accordance with Article 35 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') prior to the start of the processing and had not taken adequate technical and organisational measures in accordance with Article 32 of the GDPR, resulting in an increased risk of unauthorised access to the personal data of the pupils. Fines for several unlawful data processing activities relating to direct marketing. Hundreds of data subjects claimed to have received unsolicited communications sent without their prior consent by SMS, e-mail, telephone calls and automated calls. The data subjects were not able to exercise their right to withdraw their consent and object to processing for direct marketing purposes because the information contained in the Data Protection Policy was incomplete in relation to the contact details. Furthermore, the data protection authority stated that the data of the data subjects were published on public telephone lists despite their objection. In addition, several apps distributed by the company were set up in such a way that the user had to give his consent to various processing activities each time he accessed them, with the possibility of withdrawing consent given only after 24 hours. The fine relates to data protection infringements concerning the processing of customer data for the activation of SIM cards and the manner in which payment data was recorded. In addition, the data protection authority stated that the company had violated the principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency as well as the integrity and confidentiality with regard to the processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes and the storage of customer data in the personal area of its website.

This constituted a violation of the principles of confidentiality and integrity. A data subject had received a call from another Xfera Móviles customer who stated that the company had charged his bank account with an invoice, disclosing the personal details of the other data subject. This was due to an error on the part of Xfera Móviles and was therefore a violation of the principles of integrity and confidentiality. Following a request for erasure addressed to the company, the data subject received another newsletter from the newspaper, although El Periódico de Catalunya claimed to have granted the request. This was due to a failure of an external service provider of the company. Following a complaint, Xfera Móviles was requested by the AEPD to submit certain information and documents, but did not do so within the provided time limit. The company had not informed the data subject within one month (or up to three months if a reason for the delay is given) of the measures taken following the request for deletion of data.

One of the main criticisms made by the Data Protection Agency was the use of fake numbers to make promotional calls by the contracted call centers (i.e. phone numbers not registered with the National Consolidated Registry of Communication Operators). Furthermore, further violations could be found in the handling of contact lists purchased from external providers. Finally, security measures for the management of customer data were also considered inadequate. Xfera Móviles had failed to cooperate with the AEPD in the investigation of privacy violations.

However, the CNIL noted that other data such as postal address, telephone number and the number of children had been transmitted, although the company undertook not to transmit any further data. The Swedish DPA imposed a fine on the City of Stockholm for data breaches on a school education platform. The platform consists of different subsystems, including a system for monitoring school attendance, a student administration system, an interface for parents and an administration interface for teachers. In one of the subsystems, a lack of ability to restrict user access to the data has allowed a significant number of staff to access information about students using a protected identity. In another sub-system, parents could access information about other students, such as grades relatively easily. Via Google's search engine, it was possible to find links to enter an administrative interface where information about teachers with a protected identity was accessible.

The CNIL also notes that the company did not comply with the storage time limits. Furthermore, the data of more than twenty-eight million customers who were inactive for five to ten years were stored for the purposes of the loyalty program. This was also the case for 750,000 users of the carrefour.fr site, who were inactive for five to ten years. The CNIL states that the company required proof of identity for almost every user request to exercise a right. However, this automatic requirement was not justified, as in most cases there was no doubt regarding the identity of the data subjects. Furthermore, the company did not respond to several requests from individuals who wanted to access their personal data. Also, in numerous cases, the company did not carry out the erasure of data requested by individuals. Finally, the company has not responded to several requests from persons who did not agree to receive advertising by SMS or e-mail. The Spanish DPA (AEPD) imposed a fine of EUR 40,000 on Miraclia Telecomunicaciones S.L. for violating Articles 6, 13 and 14 of the GDPR.

Authorizations for users of the hospital information system Nationell patientöversikt (NPÖ) were not assigned according to the principle of minimum access. This gave users full access to confidential patient data that they did not need for work purposes. The Swedish DPA (Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten) fined Östergötland Region SEK 2,500,000 (EUR 243,800) for failing to implement adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure information security.

The Swedish DPA (Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten) fined Sahlgrenska University Hospital SEK 3,500,000 (EUR 341,300) for failing to implement adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure information security. It was found that there was no risk analysis regarding the access to patient data. Authorizations for users of the hospital information systems Melior and Nationell patientöversikt were not assigned according to the principle of minimum access. This gave users full access to confidential patient data that they did not need for work purposes. In addition, the Melior hospital information system did not keep records of when and for what purpose patient data was accessed. The Swedish DPA (Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten) fined Karolinska University Hospital of Solna SEK 4,000,000 (EUR 390,100) for failing to implement adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure information security.

The Swedish DPA (Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten) fined Capio St. Göran AB SEK 30,000,000 (EUR 2,900,000) for failing to implement adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure information security. It was found that there was no risk analysis regarding the access to patient data. Authorizations for users of the hospital information systems Cosmic, Nationell patientöversikt and TakeCare were not assigned according to the principle of minimum access. This gave users full access to confidential patient data that they did not need for work purposes. The Norwegian DPA (Datatilsynet) imposed a fine in the amount of NOK 200,000 (EUR 18,840) on the municipality of Indre Østfold. Datatilsynet found that a student file containing personal data was published on the municipality's website. The Spanish DPA (AEPD) imposed a fine in the amount of EUR 1,200 on a private individual for impersonating a third party on the social networks Tinder and WhatsApp by using images of the third party on their profile. The pictures were used without the consent of the data subject.  The Spanish DPA (AEPD) imposed a fine on Losada Advocats S.L. for sending an e-mail to dozens of recipients without putting them on the Blind Carbon Copy (BCC) list, thus violating Art. 32 GDPR and Art. 5 (1) f) GDPR. The Spanish DPA (AEPD) imposed a fine on Xfera Móviles, S.A. due to insufficient legal basis for data processing. The data subject states that two telephone and internet connections were registered in his/her name with a charge account. However, the data subject had never signed contracts with the company for any of these connections. In fact, the contracts in question were concluded by fraudsters using the personal data of the data subject. Nevertheless, the personal data were entered into the company's information systems without verifying whether the contracts had been lawfully and actually concluded by the data subject, whether he/she had given his/her consent to the collection and subsequent processing of his/her personal data or whether there was any other reason justifying the processing. \\xa0The Belgian DPA (APD/GBA) imposed a fine of EUR 1,500 on a social housing company for non-compliance with several principles of the GDPR such as data processing as well as the principles of legality and transparency (e.g. insufficient privacy policy, lack of information on camera surveillance). The Spanish DPA (AEPD) imposed a fine of EUR 4,000 on Borjamotor, S.A. The company kept sending commercial advertisements to the data subject via email and SMS, even though the data subject had previously revoked his/her consent to receive advertisements and submitted a request to delete his/her data. Although the company had confirmed this, the data subject continued to receive advertising. The Spanish DPA (AEPD) fined Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A. EUR 5,000,000 for violating Art. 6 GDPR (EUR 3,000,000) and Art. 13 GDPR (EUR 2,000,000). The bank had not implemented a specific mechanism to obtain the consent of the customers to process their data. Furthermore, it did not use precise terminology in its privacy policy, nor did it provide adequate information about the type of personal data that might be processed. In particular the AEPD notes that the purpose and legal basis for data processing are not sufficiently identifiable in the privacy statement. The Swedish DPA (Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten) fined Umeå University SEK 550,000 (EUR 54,000) as a result of its failure to apply appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect data. As part of a research project on male rape, the university had stored several police reports on such related incidents in the cloud of a U.S. service provider. The reports contained the names, ID numbers and contact details of the data subjects, as well as information about their health and sex lives, alongside information about the suspected crime. The DPA notes that the storage in that cloud does not adequately protect such particularly sensitive data. In addition, one of the investigation reports was sent unencrypted to the Swedish police via email. However, the controller had neither documented the incident nor reported it to the DPA. \\xa0The Polish DPA (UODO) fined Virgin Mobile Polska EUR 443,000 due to a data leak that allowed unauthorized third parties to access personal data stored by Virgin Mobile Polska as a result of inadequate security measures. The DPA notes that the company did not conduct regular and extensive tests on the effectiveness of the measures applied to ensure data security. Indeed, activities in this regard were conducted only in the event of a suspected security leak.  The Hellenic DPA (HDPA) imposed a fine of EUR 1,000 against the American College of Greece for violations of the right of access and the right to erasure of personal data.  The Irish DPA (DPC) fined Twitter International Company EUR 450,000 for violating Art. 33 (1) GDPR and Art. 33 (5) GDPR for failing to notify the DPA in a timely manner of a data breach and not adequately documenting that breach. The data breach concerned the privacy settings of user posts on the social media platform Twitter. There, users have the option to set the visibility of their posts to private or public. Private posts can only be seen by subscribers of the respective user profile, while public posts are visible to the public. A programming bug in Twitter's Android app resulted in some private posts being visible to the public. The DPA found that Twitter had not properly fulfilled its reporting and documentation obligations. Twitter's legal team became aware of the error on January 2nd, 2019, and it was not until January 8th that the company informed the DPC. Consequently, the company failed to inform the DPC within the 72-hour period required by Art. 33 (1) GDPR. Furthermore, it had failed to adequately document the incident in accordance with Art. 33 (5) GDPR. The Swedish DPA (Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten) fined the housing company Uppsalahem AB SEK 300,000 (EUR 29,500). The housing company had installed surveillance cameras in an apartment building to monitor one floor after disturbances and security incidents occurred. The cameras not only monitored the staircase, but also the front door of a resident. Therefore, when the door was opened, the inside of the apartment was also captured by the video surveillance. While the company may have had a legitimate interest in the video surveillance, this is outweighed by the residents' right to privacy. The Latvian DPA (DSI) fined the online store HH Invest SIA EUR 15,000. The information provided on the company's website regarding the privacy policy was found not to be easily understandable. This constitutes a violation of Art. 13 GDPR. The Latvian DPA (DSI) fined an employer EUR 6,250 for sending personal data of an employee, including health data, to fellow employees by email. The DSI found that the data subject's personal data had been processed without a proper legal basis and thus this processing was unlawful. The Romanian DPA (ANSPDCP) fined Banca Transilvania SA EUR 100,000 for violations of Art. 5 (1) f) GDPR, Art. 32 (1) GDPR and Art. 32 (2) GDPR. It was found that the bank requested a declaration from a customer about the intended use of a certain amount of money wished to withdraw from its account. This statement was submitted to the bank online and forwarded to several employees of the bank. One employee photographed the declaration with his cell phone and spread it via WhatsApp. Subsequently, the document was posted on the social network Facebook and on a website. This situation led to the disclosure and unauthorized access of certain personal data concerning four data subjects, despite the Bank's commitment to respect the principle of integrity and confidentiality of personal data as required by Art. 5 (1) f) GDPR. The DPA notes that the occurred disclosure of the data also proves the ineffectiveness of the internal training of the Bank's employees regarding compliance with the standards for data protection. These trainings are, however, an integral part of the technical and organizational measures that the Bank was obliged to implement, Art. 32 GDPR. The French DPA (CNIL) fined a doctor EUR 3,000 for violations of Art. 32 GDPR and Art. 33 GDPR. The controller had stored medical image data as MRI and X-ray images as well as personal data such as the names, dates of birth and treatment data of his patients on his computer. The controller had not taken appropriate technical measures to ensure the security of the data, and as a consequence, access to his patients' data was possible for anyone without access protection. The data protection authority notes that the data had been exposed for about four months. The French DPA (CNIL) fined a doctor EUR 6,000 for violations of Art. 32 GDPR and Art. 33 GDPR. The controller had stored medical image data such as MRI and X-ray images as well as personal data such as names, dates of birth and treatment data of his patients on a server in order to be able to access them from his home computer. A review of the controller's systems had revealed that access to the server was not properly secured. This would have allowed anyone to access his patients' data. Furthermore, the data leak had existed for about five years. The data protection authority therefore found that the doctor had failed to take adequate technical and organisational measures to ensure data security. \\xa0The Spanish DPA (AEPD) fined the operator of the online store banderacatalana.cat. EUR 10,000 for a violation of Art. 13 GDPR. The operator stated on its website privacy notices that a minimum age of 13 or sufficient legal capacity was required to subscribe to the newsletter. It was also stated that filling out the newsletter subscription form would be considered as consent to the processing of personal data. This constitutes a violation of the GDPR, as according to Art. 8 GDPR, the processing of personal data of under-16-year-olds requires the consent of the holder of parental responsibility over the child. The Hungarian DPA (NAIH) imposed a fine of HUF 700,000 (EUR 1,940) against a construction company. The controller had installed a video surveillance system at a construction site to protect its property and the physical integrity of the employees. The cameras were aligned in a way that they were able to record a part of the recreation room and thus also the activities of his employees beyond a required extent. The data subjects were not sufficiently informed about this at the time their contract was concluded. \\xa0The Hungarian DPA (NAIH) imposed a fine of HUF 20,500,000 (EUR 55,400) on Robinson Tours Idegenforgalmi és Szolgáltató Kft. (Robinson Tours Ltd.) The travel agent's reservation system contained unprotected data of customers, which could be viewed by anyone and found via Google. The data contained, among others, names, contact and address data, copies of personal IDs and passport numbers. During the DPA's investigation, it turned out that the data in question was from a test database created by Next Time Media Agency Ltd, the web agency contracted to develop and operate the database, which was supplemented not only with test data but also with real data of Robinson Tours' customers. In total, the data of 781 individuals was affected, which was accessible by anyone in the period from November 13, 2019 to February 4, 2020. The NAIH also notes that Robinson Tours did not conduct regular security risk screenings. Robinson Tours also failed to notify the data subjects about the data breach. The Hungarian DPA (NAIH) imposed a fine of HUF 50,000 (EUR 1,385) on Next Time Media Ügynökség Kft. (Next Time Media Agency Ltd.). The web agency had been contracted by the travel agency Robinson Tours Idegenforgalmi és Szolgáltató Kft. (Robinson Tours Ltd.) to develop and operate the travel agency's online reservation system. However, the database was not only supplemented with test data, but also with real data of Robinson Tours' customers. In total, the data of 781 people was compromised. During the period from November 13, 2019, to February 4, 2020, these data were accessible to anyone and could be found via Google. The DPA found that Next Time Media Agency Ltd. did not take adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the personal data. The Spanish DPA (AEPD) fined the financial and credit institution Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A. (BBVA) with a fine in the amount of EUR 36,000. The BBVA asked the data subject to settle debts with the BBVA, although the data subject did not have any debts with the bank. As a result, BBVA had transmitted the personal data of the data subject to the debt collection company Multigestión Iberia, S.L., which, over a period of several months, contacted the data subject by telephone and e-mail on behalf of BBVA and requested the payment. The data subject then demanded the erasure of his/her data from BBVA. However, the controller refused to do so. The Spanish DPA (AEPD) fined Iberdrola Clientes, SAU EUR 6,000. The data subject had received promotional calls from two different telephone numbers of the controller although the data subject was registered in the Robinson list. The company attributes the incident to a human error, as the telephone numbers from which the data subject was called were not regularly used for advertising purposes. The Romanian DPA (ANSPDCP) fined S.C. C&V Water Control S.A. EUR 2,000 for failure to comply with the data protection authority's request for information in the course of an investigation, thus violating Art. 58 (1) a), e) GDPR and Art. 58 (2) i) GDPR. The Belgian DPA (APD) imposed a fine of EUR 50,000 on a company for several violations of the GDPR. The controller is a company that carries out parking ticket controls. The controller controller had issued the data subject a fine for illegal parking. However, the data subject states that he or she did not receive the fine ticket. Instead, the data subject only found out about it when he or she received an official reminder letter from a law firm commissioned with debt collection, which then demanded payment of the reminder fee in addition to the original fine. The data subject then contacted the company and demanded, among others, information about which of his/her personal data had been processed. After this request was not properly fulfilled in a timely manner, the data subject filed a complaint against the controller During its investigations the DPA discovered that the controller violated several GDPR provisions. Firstly the DPA found that the controller failed to provide a proper privacy policy. The privacy policy on the controller´s website did not contain any information regarding the processing of personal data nor any contact information of the company. Secondly, the controller violated the data subject's right to information by failing to comply with the data subject's request for information on data processing. Lastly the controller infringed the principle of minimasation by processing the data subject's data for the purpose of sending a payment reminder only one day after the ticket had been issued even though the data subject had the opportunity to pay the fine without such a reminder at that time. The Belgian DPA (APD) imposed a fine of EUR 15,000 on a company due to insufficient fulfilment of data subject rights. The controller is a debt collection agency which was commissioned by another company to collect debts owed to it. The data subject was issued a fine for illegal parking by the last-mentioned company. However, the data subject states that he/she did not receive the fine notice. Instead, the data subject only learned about it when he/she received an official reminder letter from the controller, which then demanded payment of the reminder fees in addition to the original fine. The data subject then contacted the controller and requested, among other things, information about which of his/her personal data had been processed. After this request was not fulfilled in a timely manner, the data subject filed a complaint against the controller . During its investigation, the DPA found that the controller had violated provisions of the GDPR, for example, by failing to comply with the data subject's request for information on the data processing.  The Polish DPA (UODO) fined Towarzystwo Ubezpieczeń i Reasekuracji WARTA S.A. EUR 18,930 for a breach of Art. 33 (1) GDPR and Art. 34 (1) GDPR. In May 2020, the DPA received a notification from a third party about a personal data breach involving an insurance agent acting as a processing agent for Towarzystwo Ubezpieczeń i Reasekuracji WARTA S.A. who sent an insurance policy to an unauthorized addressee by email. The document contained personal data concerning, among others, surnames, first names, residential addresses and information on the subject of the insurance policy. As a result, the supervisory authority asked the controller to clarify whether, regarding the sending of the electronic correspondence to an unauthorized addressee, a risk analysis on the data security of natural persons had been carried out, which is necessary to evaluate whether a data breach had occurred. Such a breach requires notification to the DPA and the individuals affected by the breach. In the letter, the supervisory authority advised the controller how to notify the breach and asked for explanations. Despite the letter requesting explanations, the controller did not report the data breach nor did it inform the data subjects about the incident. The DPA therefore initiated administrative proceedings. Only as a result of the initiation of the procedure did the controller report the personal data breach and inform two individuals affected by the breach. The television station broadcasted a documentary about the link between emissions from a local ceramics plant and health problems in the population, in which the person interviewed was not made sufficiently anonymous. The union UILCOM Sardegna filed a complaint with the Italian DPA (garante) against the call center operator Concentrix Cvg Italy s.r.l. regarding an internal regulation of the controller. Under the terms of a 'clean desk policy,' the company had prohibited employees from keeping certain items, such as smartphones, on their desks, which was intended to ensure confidentiality in the processing of customers' personal data. Exceptions were made for medication, which the data subjects proved they needed to take during their shift. These had to be placed visibly on the desk, making it indirectly possible for other employees to obtain information on the health status of the data subjects. The controller had indeed informed the data subjects about the rules of procedure and obtained their consents. However, this did not contain any information on the processing of their health data. The Romanian DPA (ANSPDCP) fined Qualitance QBS SA EUR 1,000 for a violation of Art. 32 GDPR. The company had sent information by email to 295 individuals, disclosing the email addresses of the other recipients. The ANSPDCP noted that the company had not taken sufficient security measures to ensure the confidentiality of the personal data of the data subjects. The Romanian DPA (ANSPDCP) fined ING Bank N.V. Amsterdam - Bucharest office in the amount of EUR 3,000. The bank had contacted the data subject by e-mail for the purpose of updating his data. At that time, however, the data subject had already terminated his account with the bank, so that the contractual relationship had been terminated. As a result, the data controller had unlawfully processed personal data of the former customer without his consent such as the e-mail address and the name and of the data subject. The data subject had concluded a contract with the controller (Vodafone España, S.A.U.). However, the products provided under this contract were not delivered in the name of the data subject, but in the name of a third party. Subsequently, the data subject contacted the company's data protection officer by e-mail in order to restore the accuracy of his/her data stored at Vodafone. However, no response was received to this request. When the data subject finally contacted the telecommunications company by telephone, he/she was addressed by the name of the third party. His/her inquiry was answered with a response that did not refer to his/her inquiry, but to the inquiry of the third party. According to the telecommunications company, the incident was caused by a defect in their system due to a system migration. The Spanish DPA (AEPD) initially fined Vodafone España, S.A.U. EUR 90,000, but the original fine was reduced to EUR 54,000 due to the timely payment and admission of guilt. The Norwegian DPA (Datatilsynet) fined the national development bank Innovasjon Norge NOK 1,000,000 (EUR 95,500). The controller had carried out four credit checks on the data subject without any contractual basis for doing so. For this purpose, the bank had analyzed numerous financial data of the data subject over a period of three months without the data subject's consent. The French DPA (CNIL) imposed a fine of EUR 7,300 on the company Perfomeclic. The company had sent commercial advertising emails without a proof of prior consent and without sufficient information. The Polish DPA (UODO) imposed a fine of EUR 235,300 on ID Finance Poland Sp. z o.o. Due to an error while restarting a server, the settings of the software responsible for the server's security were reset, making the personal data of 140 699 customers publicly available. These data contained, for example, information about the first and last name, address, nationality or even marital status of the data subjects. The database located on this server was downloaded and deleted by an unspecified third party, who demanded a fee from the company for the return of the database. The DPA noted that the controller had taken insufficient technical and organizational measures to ensure the protection of the processing, even though there was a high risk for the data subjects due to the nature of the data processed. \\xa0An insurance agent hired by the controller had sent an email to unauthorized third parties in regard to insurance policies that contained personal data of two of the company's customers after they had mistakenly provided false email addresses. The leaked data included data such as the names, email adresses and postal addresses of the data subjects. The controller had not informed either the Polish DPA nor the data subjects about the data breach in a timely manner within 72 hours. The controller believed that there was no breach requiring notification because the data subjects themselves had mistakenly provided incorrect e-mail addresses. The Polish DPA states that this circumstance does not release the controller from its obligation to report this data breach in a timely manner. The French DPA (CNIL) fined the company Nestor EUR 20,000. The CNIL notes that the privacy policy provided during the registration process on the company´s website did not contain the necessary information required by the GDPR. In addition, the controller provided insufficient information on data processing during app registration. The Polish DPA (UODO) imposed a fine of EUR 1,770 on L. Sp. z o.o. for the video surveillance of a residential community, which was not in compliance with the provisions of the GDPR. The Czech DPA (UOOU) fined 11 companies a total of EUR 118,500 for sending unrequested postal advertising messages to the mailboxes of various citizens. Based on a decision by the government of the Czech Republic at the end of October, there was introduced the possibility to send postal data messages at no charge until the end of the Covid-19 pandemic. The fined companies misused this possibility. The DPA finds that the companies had no legal ground for sending offers for goods and services, constituting a breach of Art. 6 (1) GDPR. The DPA furthermore finds that a violation of Art. 14 GDPR has also occurred, as the companies did not provide the data subjects with information about the commercial use of their data when they first contacted them. The Norwegian DPA (Datatilsynet) has fined Lindstrand Trading AS EUR 9,700. The controller had carried out four credit checks on individuals and individual companies, although there was no legal basis for doing so. The Norwegian DPA (Datatilsynet) fined Gveik AS EUR 7,250. The controller had carried out a credit check on an individual, although there was no legal basis for doing so. The Estonian DPA (Andmekaitse Inspektsioon) fined three online pharmacies EUR 100,000 each for processing personal data without the consent of the data subjects. The data in question are prescriptions for medicines of the data subjects. Third parties were able to view another person's current prescriptions in the e-pharmacy environment without their consent, based only on access to their personal identification code. The DPA highlighted that while it must be possible to purchase prescription drugs for other people, it is the responsibility of the company to ensure that the processing of the personal data required for this purpose only takes place with the consent of the data subjects. The confirmation of another person that they may access the data, however, does not correspond to the voluntary consent of the prescription holder, since the e-pharmacy cannot check whether and for what purpose the consent was given and whether it was given voluntarily.

The data subject had subscribed to a newsletter of the controller. After altering his/her e-mail address, he/she continued to receive the newsletter via the old e-mail address. The data subject then contacted the controller, whereupon the controller confirmed that the address had now been updated. Nevertheless, the data subject continued to receive the newsletter via the old e-mail address. \\xa0The Polish DPA (UODO) imposed a fine of PLN 25,000 (EUR 5,500) on the Medical University of Silesia. In the course of exams held in the form of videoconferences at the end of May 2020, identification of students took place. Once the exam was completed, the recordings of the exams were available not only to the examinees, but also to other people with access to the system. In addition, any outsider could access the records of the examinations and the data of the examined students presented during identification via a direct link. The University failed to report the data breach to the DPA and notify the data subjects. The Spanish DPA (AEPD) imposed a fine of EUR 50,000 on Alterna Operador Integral S.L.. A switch of the electricity supplier had taken place without the consent of the data subject. However, the personal data of the data subject were incorporated into the information systems of the controller (the new electricity supplier) without the controller having verified that a valid contract had been concluded. The processing of the data subjects' personal data thus took place without a legal basis. The Italian DPA (Garante) fined the municipality of Rome EUR 500,000 for the unlawful processing of users' and employees' personal data. The municipality of Rome had been using the 'TuPassi' booking system to manage appointments and other services since 2015. In the course of a detailed investigation, the Italian DPA found that the controller had violated several data protection regulations with regard to the processing of personal data of customers and employees with whom they had made appointments. For example, the municipality had not properly informed the data subjects prior to processing their data, nor had it taken appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the processing. The Belgian DPA fined a mobile operator EUR 25,000. The controller had assigned the data subject's phone number to an unauthorized third party, causing the data subject to lose access to his/her phone number. As the SIM card of the data subject had been deactivated, that would have allowed the third party to access various personal data of the data subject in the period between September 16 and September 19, 2019, such as call history and accounts of various services (e.g. Paypal, WhatsApp and Facebook) associated with the number. The Spanish DPA (AEPD) imposed a fine of EUR 75,000 on Telefónica Móviles España, SAU. The controller had assigned five telephone lines with five numbers to the data subject as part of a mobile phone contract. One of the numbers was used by her son. When he was no longer able to use the mobile data, he contacted the controller. The controller informed him that the mobile data had been deactivated because the number was no longer in his possession. It turned out that unauthorized third parties had pretended to be the data subject and had the number transferred to a third party without the controller requiring authentication for this. Thereupon the unauthorized third parties had requested and received a replacement SIM card under the pretense of an alleged loss or theft. As a result, the son's SIM card was blocked. The French DPA (CNIL) fined a company and its subcontractor EUR 150,000 and EUR 75,000 for failing to take sufficient measures against credential stuffing attacks on the company's website. Between June 2018 and January 2020, the CNIL received several notifications of personal data breaches related to a website where several million customers regularly shop. In response, the CNIL decided to investigate the company and its subcontractor entrusted with the management of this website. In the course of its investigations, the CNIL found that the website in question had been subjected to numerous waves of credential stuffing attacks. In this type of attack, a malicious person obtains lists of 'unencrypted' identifiers and passwords published on the Internet, usually after a data breach. Assuming that users frequently use the same password and username (email address) for different services, the attacker will use 'bots' to try to log in to a large number of websites. If the authentication is successful, this will allow the attacker to see the information associated with those accounts. The CNIL found that the attackers were able to obtain the following information: Surname, first name, email address and date of birth of customers, as well as their loyalty card number and balance, and information related to their orders. The CNIL considers that the two companies had breached their obligation to maintain the security of customers' personal data under Article 32 of the GDR. In fact, the companies took slow action to effectively combat these repeated attacks. They had decided to focus their response strategy on developing a tool to detect and block attacks launched by robots. However, the development of this tool took a year from the first attacks. In the meantime, however, a number of other measures with faster impact could have been considered to prevent further attacks or mitigate the negative impact on individuals. As a result of this lack of diligence, the data of approximately 40,000 website customers was made available to unauthorized third parties between March 2018 and February 2019. The French DPA (CNIL) fined a company and its subcontractor EUR 150,000 and EUR 75,000 for failing to take sufficient measures against credential stuffing attacks on the company's website. Between June 2018 and January 2020, the CNIL received several notifications of personal data breaches related to a website where several million customers regularly shop. In response, the CNIL decided to investigate the company and its subcontractor entrusted with the management of this website. In the course of its investigations, the CNIL found that the website in question had been subjected to numerous waves of credential stuffing attacks. In this type of attack, a malicious person obtains lists of 'unencrypted' identifiers and passwords published on the Internet, usually after a data breach. Assuming that users frequently use the same password and username (email address) for different services, the attacker will use 'bots' to try to log in to a large number of websites. If the authentication is successful, this will allow the attacker to see the information associated with those accounts. The CNIL found that the attackers were able to obtain the following information: Surname, first name, email address and date of birth of customers, as well as their loyalty card number and balance, and information related to their orders. The CNIL considers that the two companies had breached their obligation to maintain the security of customers' personal data under Article 32 of the GDR. In fact, the companies took slow action to effectively combat these repeated attacks. They had decided to focus their response strategy on developing a tool to detect and block attacks launched by robots. However, the development of this tool took a year from the first attacks. In the meantime, however, a number of other measures with faster impact could have been considered to prevent further attacks or mitigate the negative impact on individuals. As a result of this lack of diligence, the data of approximately 40,000 website customers was made available to unauthorized third parties between March 2018 and February 2019. The Belgian DPA imposed a fine of EUR 50,000 on Family Service / N.D.P.K. nv. The controller is an advertising agency that, among other things, sends expectant mothers gift boxes containing various discount vouchers, product samples and information about pregnancy and birth. The box items are provided by third parties, to whom the controller subsequently transfers the recipients' contact data for marketing purposes. The consent of the recipients to this transfer and to subsequent advertising measures by the third parties is obtained in advance by the controller for this purpose. A data subject filed a complaint with the Belgian DPA because, although she had revoked her previously given consent, she nevertheless continued to receive advertising calls from third parties to whom the controller had transmitted her data. \\xa0The Italian DPA (Garante) imposed a fine of EUR 100,000 on Azienda USL Toscana Sud Est. The controller is a company in the healthcare sector that, among other things, launched the so-called 'Sanità di iniziativa' (Health Initiative) program. Within the framework of this program, participating healthcare companies transmit data on chronically ill patients to the controller. On the basis of this data, the controller then develops health plans for the patients. The Italian DPA notes several violations of data protection provisions related to this program. For example, when giving consent to the processing of their data, the data subjects were not adequately informed about how long their data would be stored, what rights they had (in particular their rights of complaint and access), and how exactly their data would be processed and for what purpose. In addition, the controller had not kept a register of processing activities. Finally, the controller had neither implemented adequate technical and organizational measures to protect the processing nor conducted a data protection impact assessment, although this would have been necessary due to the nature of the data processed (health data). The Spanish DPA (AEPD) imposed a fine of EUR 5,000 on IDFINANCE Spain S.L.. A person had received a debt collection email from IDFinance that contained a link for the payment of an invoice directly through the controller's website. Via the link, the person was able to view the personal data of another customer. The original fine of EUR 5,000 was reduced to EUR 3,000 due to immediate payment and acknowledgement of debt.  The Spanish DPA (AEPD) imposed a fine of EUR 100,000 on Iberdrola Clientes, SAU. The data subject had terminated an existing contract with the controller due to a move and therefore requested the deletion of his/her data. This request was rejected by the controller with reference to outstanding invoices. It turned out that the controller had sent the bills to the old address of the data subject. Even after the data subject informed the controller of the change of address, new notices regarding the deletion request and invoices were sent to the old address. \\xa0The company website did not present a privacy policy on its main page, nor did it provide the information required by Art. 13 GDPR. The Irish DPA (DPC) fined University College Dublin (UCD) EUR 70,000 due to seven personal data breaches. Unauthorized third parties were able to access UCD e-mail accounts, and login credentials for UCD e-mail accounts were posted online. It was found that the controller did not take appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect data security when processing personal data in its email service. In addition, the controller stored certain personal data in an email account in a form that allowed identification of the data subjects for longer than necessary for the purpose for which the personal data were processed. Also, the controller did not notify the DPC of a personal data breach in a timely manner. The Latvian DPA (DSI) fined Lursoft IT SIA EUR 65,000 for the illegal processing of personal data by publishing documents containing personal data on its website 'www.lursoft.lv'. The DPA found that the controller made parts of the non-public company register, which contained, among other things personal data, publicly available. The Dutch DPA (AP) imposed a fine of EUR 440,000 on the Amsterdam hospital OLVG. The controller had taken insufficient measures between 2018 and 2020 to prevent access by unauthorized employees to medical records. The controller did not check adequately who had access to which file nor did the controller ensure that the computer system presented sufficient security. This resulted, among others, in working students and other employees being able to access patient files without this being necessary for their work. Besides medical records, the patient files also contained, the social security numbers, addresses and telephone numbers of the data subjects. The Italian DPA (Garante) imposed a fine of EUR 8,000 on the Regional Environmental Protection Agency of Campania (ARPAC). An external hard drive containing personal data had been stolen from the controller. Among other things, it contained copies of identity documents, tax records and payroll records. During the investigation, the DPA discovered that the hard drive had been located in a room to which all of the controller's employees had access. In addition, the controller did not back up the affected data, so it was irrevocably lost. Consequently, the DPA concluded that the controller violated the duty to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of data processing. \\xa0The Spanish DPA (AEPD) imposed a fine of EUR 1,000 on The Washpoint S.L. for the lack of a privacy policy on its website, in violation of Art. 13 GDPR. \\xa0The Italian DPA (Garante) fined Azienda Usl di Bologna EUR 18,000. In a hospital operated by the controller, 49 patients in the oncology ward received discharge letters with detailed pharmacological therapy information that originated from other patients. Fourteen of these patients had already accessed this incorrect documentation before it was corrected. The breakdown had occurred due to a manual error by a technician. The Polish DPA (UODO) fined Krajowa Szkoła Sądownictwa i Prokuratury (National School of Justice and Prosecution) EUR 22,200. UODO launched an investigation against the controller after it reported a data breach on its training platform website. During a test migration to the new platform, the data of more than 50,000 individuals had been exposed on the Internet. Among other things, this included the names, user names, postal and e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, units and departments of the data subjects. UODO found that the controller had not taken adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure the confidentiality of the data processed. In addition, the contract that the controller had concluded with the company entrusted with the processing of the data did not comply with the legal requirements. For example, the contract did not contain information about which categories of data would be processed. \\xa0The Irish DPA (DPC) fined Tusla Child and Family Agency EUR 85,000. The controller had reported 71 data breaches to the Irish DPA that occurred between May 25 and November 16, 2018, and concerned the unauthorized access of personal data processed by the controller. After a broad investigation, the DPA concluded that the controller failed to implement adequate technical and organizational measures to protect the data processing and thus violated Art. 32 (1) of the GDPR. The Lithuanian DPA (VDAI) imposed a fine of EUR 12,000 on the Lithuanian National Health Service (NVSC). The DPA had opened an investigation regarding a quarantine app introduced in Lithuania during the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020. The IT company 'IT sprendimai sėkmei' had developed the app, which was then used by the NVSC. In the course of the investigation, the DPA found that during the app's period of use, the data of a total of 677 individuals had been processed in varying degrees. The app was able to collect data such as the name, address and phone number of the data subjects. The DPA concluded that the controller had not taken sufficient technical and organizational measures to protect the data processing. Furthermore, a data protection impact assessment was not carried out, although this would have been necessary in particular because the app also processed special categories of personal data including health data. The DPA further stated that the controller had provided non-transparent and incorrect information in the app's privacy policy. The Lithuanian DPA (VDAI) imposed a fine of EUR 3,000 on the company 'IT sprendimai sėkmei'. The DPA had opened an investigation regarding a quarantine app introduced in Lithuania during the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020. The controller had developed the app, which was then used by the Lithuanian National Health Service. In the course of the investigation, the DPA found that during the app's period of use, the data of a total of 677 individuals had been processed in varying degrees. The app was able to collect data such as the name, address and phone number of the data subjects. The DPA concluded that the controller had not taken sufficient technical and organizational measures to protect the data processing. Furthermore, a data protection impact assessment was not carried out, although this would have been necessary in particular because the app also processed special categories of personal data including health data. The DPA further stated that the controller had provided non-transparent and incorrect information in the app's privacy policy. The Spanish DPA (AEPD) imposed a fine of EUR 9,000 on a website operator. The controller had published photos of the data subject on its website without the consent of the data subject. Also, the website in question did not contain a privacy statement. The fine is composed as follows: EUR 5,000 for a violation of Art. 6 GDPR and EUR 4,000 for a violation of Art. 13 GDPR. The Lithuanian DPA (VDAI) imposed a fine of EUR 15,000 on Registrų Centras. The controller is a company which manages several Lithuanian registers. The company suffered a data breach that affected 22 of these registers. During its investigation, the DPA found that the controller had not implemented adequate technical and organizational measures to protect the processing of personal data. The measures implemented by the controller were clearly not sufficient to ensure the continuous integrity, availability and resilience of the data, nor to restore the availability of the data after incidents. The Cypriot DPA imposed a fine of EUR 6,000 against KEPIDES (real estate company). The controller had submitted a list of buyers of the properties it manages to a parliamentary committee. However, the controller had failed to anonymize the list, as a result of which the names of the data subjects were transmitted. The Romanian DPA (ANSPDCP) imposed a fine in the amount of EUR 500 against a natural person holding the position of General Secretary for a political party in Bucharest. The controller had published a list on a social network, which contained personal data such as names, signatures, nationalities, dates of birth, postal addresses, of ten supporters of the party. The DPA found that the controller had failed to implement adequate technical and organizational measures to protect the processing of personal data. In addition, the controller had not sufficiently cooperated with the DPA in its investigation. The Polish DPA (UODO) fined Enea S.A. EUR 30,000 for the controller's failure to report a personal data breach, in violation of Art. 33 (1) GDPR. The DPA received information about a personal data breach from a person who had become an unauthorized recipient of personal data. The breach consisted of sending an email with an unencrypted, non-password protected attachment that contained personal data of several hundred individuals. The sender of the email was an employee of the sanctioned controller. \\xa0The Italian DPA (Garante) imposed a fine of EUR 4,000 on the municipality of Santo Stefano Belbo. The reason for this was that the controller had published two documents on a legal settlement of the data subject on its website. The documents were not only freely accessible, but could also be downloaded. The documents contained personal data and information about the data subject, including, in addition to his first and last name, a confirmation of the payment of legal costs, the IBAN code of his checking account, information about the lawsuit and the amounts paid in favor of the data subject. \\xa0The Italian DPA (Garante) imposed a fine of EUR 10,000 on the municipality of Luino. The controller had published a document containing personal data of a local council member. In addition to personal data, the document also contained information about a complaint procedure filed against him by the mayor. The freely accessible document could be downloaded without further authentication. Furthermore, the municipality had failed to name a data protection officer and to provide the DPA with his/her contact details. The Spanish DPA (AEPD) imposed a fine of EUR 150,000 on Xfera Móviles S.A.. The DPA had received two complaints from a data subject. The first complaint concerned the sending of advertising SMS messages that the data subject received from the controller, although he had objected to this and requested that his data be deleted. According to the data subject, he received over 60 SMS messages within 30 days. The second complaint was filed by the data subject because the controller repeatedly sent him messages containing confidential data of a third party. This concerned the login information of another customer to a company platform. On the portal, it was possible to view personal information as well as invoices, among other things. Although the data subject had informed the company of this, the incorrect mailing did not end. The original fine of EUR 150,000 was reduced to EUR 90,000 due to immediate payment and admission of guilt. The Spanish DPA (AEPD) has fined NBQ Technology, S.A.U. EUR 20,000. An identity thief had obtained the data of a third party without authorization and applied for a microcredit from the controller under pretence of the data subject's identity. The controller then approved the loan. Since the data processed in the course of granting the loan did not belong to the loan recipient, but to the data subject, the AEPD determined that the controller did not have a legal basis for processing the data. The processing was therefore unlawful, and a breach of Art. 6 (1) GDPR was affirmed. The original fine of EUR 20,000 was reduced to EUR 12,000 due to immediate payment and acknowledgement of debt. \\xa0The Italian DPA (Garante) has fined the Ministry of Economic Development (Ministero dello Sviluppo Economico) EUR 75,000 for failing to appoint a data protection officer by May 28, 2018, and for publishing personal data of more than five thousand managers on its website. In Italy, small and medium-sized companies that had previously received a relevant voucher could book advice on technological and digital processes from experienced business professionals, through the controller. The Italian DPA launched an investigation against the controller after it became known that personal data of more than five thousand managers who had made themselves available for corresponding consultations were freely accessible on its website. The personal data, such as name, tax number, e-mail, full CV and in some cases a copy of the identity card and health card of the data subjects, was publicly visible and could be freely downloaded. On the website, it was also possible to download the directorate resolution that had approved the list, which included the data and information of all the directors. The DPA found that the processing was unlawful and that the directorate resolution referred to by the controller did not constitute an adequate legal basis for the disclosure of online data. The Spanish DPA (AEPD) fined Heredad de Urueña S.A. EUR 2,000 because its personal data processing policy did not comply with the requirements of Art. 13 GDPR. In addition, the controller did not provide a privacy policy on its website informing users about the processing of their personal data. The Spanish DPA (AEPD) imposed a fine of EUR 60,000 on Vodafone Spain. The data subject had been a customer of the controller several years ago. After receiving payment reminders from the controller via SMS for services she had never booked, she informed the controller and asked for clarification and deletion of her data. Despite a positive response, she continued to receive the same SMS. The data subject then filed two complaints with the Spanish DPA against Vodafone Spain. Both times, the controller had assured that it had corrected the reason for the incorrect sending and deleted the data of the data subject. Nevertheless, the mailing continued, leading the data subject to file a third complaint. The original fine of EUR 100,000 was reduced to EUR 60,000 due to immediate payment and admission of guilt. In February, the Romanian DPA (ANSPDCP) closed an investigation against S.C. Medicover S.R.L. and found a violation of Art. 32 (1) b), (2), (4) GDPR. The DPA imposed a fine of EUR 2,000 on the controller. The investigation was initiated following successive notifications by the controller regarding personal data breaches related to unauthorized disclosure and unauthorized access to personal data such as name, correspondence address, email and health data of the data subjects. On several occasions, documents containing personal data had been sent to the wrong recipients. The DPA found that the incidents occurred due to the controller's failure to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the processing of personal data. \\xa0The Spanish DPA (AEPD) fined Air Europa Lineas Aereas, SA. EUR 600,000 after a serious data breach involving unauthorized access to contact details and bank accounts was reported to the AEPD. Approximately 489,000 individuals and 1,500,000 records were affected. The AEPD announced that it had fined the controller EUR 500,000 for a breach of Art. 32 (1) GDPR due to the failure to take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure an adequate level of security, and EUR 100,000 for a breach of Art. 33 GDPR for notifying the AEPD of the security breach 41 days late. In determining the amount of the fine, the fact that the incident was not limited to a local area, but affected a large number of people not only in Spain, but also worldwide, and that sensitive banking and financial data were affected, harming several thousand people, was taken into account as an aggravating factor. The Italian DPA (Garante) imposed a fine of EUR 2,000 on the municipality of Conflenti. A former employee of the municipality filed a complaint with the DPA because a document containing her personal data, including information about her employment with the municipality and an excerpt from the termination letter, was published on the municipality's website. The Dutch DPA (Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens) has fined Booking.com EUR 475,000 for not reporting a data breach to the DPA in a timely manner. In December 2018, criminals gained access to the data of 4,109 people who had booked a hotel room through the booking site. That included their names, addresses and phone numbers, as well as details about their booking. The criminals also accessed the credit card data of 283 people and managed to access the credit card's security code in 97 cases. Furthermore, they tried to get other victims' credit card details by pretending to be Booking.com employees via email or phone. Booking.com was notified of the data breach on January 13, 2019, but did not report it to the DPA until February 7, 2019. The controller was thus 22 days late in reporting the data breach, as it is required to report a data breach to the DPA within 72 hours. The Romania DPA (ANSPDCP) has fined Telekom Romania Mobile Communications S.A. EUR 10,000 for failing to implement adequate security measures to ensure the security of personal data processing. In particular, the ANSPDCP's investigation revealed that the controllers' failure to implement adequate security measures resulted in the unauthorized disclosure of the data of 99,210 data subjects, including their customer number, gender and telephone number, as well as unauthorized access to the personal data stored in the accounts of 413 customers. On this basis, the ANSPDCP ruled that the controller violated Art. 32 (1) and (2) GDPR. The Italian DPA (Garante) imposed a fine of EUR 6,000 on the municipality of Commezzadura. A former employee of the municipality filed a complaint with the DPA because a document containing his personal data was published on the municipality's website. The document contained the confirmation and acceptance of the employee's voluntary termination of employment and information about the employment relationship at that time, including evaluations of his work and information about his health. The data subject also complained that this information had been mentioned in an article in a newspaper. In particular, the article discussed the end of employment and quoted a statement by the mayor of the municipality referring to the fact that the data subject had asked for flexible working hours and had been absent from work during the Christmas vacations due to illness. \\xa0The Italian DPA (Garante) has imposed a fine of EUR 5,000 on the Foundation for Religion and Worship 'Casa sollievo della sofferenza' Opera di San Pio da Pietrelcina. On January 31, 2020, the controller notified the DPA of a personal data breach under Art. 33 GDPR. Documents containing information about the health status of the data subject had been accidentally sent by mail to the wrong addressee. This had happened due to a mix-up: An invoice had previously been sent not to the data subject, but to another person with the same name, whose address had then been used for further correspondence with the data subject. The Italian DPA (Garante) fined the city of Rome EUR 350,000 for failing to take adequate technical and organizational measures regarding the data of citizens who had obtained permits to access restricted traffic areas. The permits were verified by scanning QR codes located on badges affixed to windshields. This allowed city staff to verify in real time whether the particular vehicle was allowed to be in the zone and to whom the permit had been issued. However, according to the DPA, not only city staff, but anyone could scan the codes and access the information, as it only required an ordinary QR scanner. The information stored in the system, included, for example, the name of the user or the license plate number of the vehicle. In addition, the DPA found that the city of Rome had used the services of a provider for the hosting and maintenance of databases without a proper agreement as required by Art. 28 GDPR. The Italian DPA (Garante) fined Roma Servizi per La Mobilita S.r.l. EUR 60,000 for failing to take adequate technical and organizational measures regarding the data of citizens who had obtained permits to access restricted traffic areas. The controller was acting as a processor for the city of Rome. As part of this activity, it processed the data of individuals who held permits for restricted traffic areas. The permits were verified by scanning QR codes located on badges affixed to windshields. This allowed city staff to verify in real time whether the particular vehicle was allowed to be in the zone and to whom the permit had been issued. However, according to the DPA, not only city staff, but anyone could scan the codes and access the information, as it only required an ordinary QR scanner. The information stored in the system, included, for example, the name of the user or the license plate number of the vehicle. The DPA notes that the controller did not analyze the risk associated with the data processing and, as a result, did not implement adequate measures to protect the processing. The Italian DPA (Garante) has fined Fastweb S.p.A. EUR 4,500,000 for aggressive telemarketing. Following a complex preliminary investigation launched after hundreds of reports and complaints from users, the DPA finds that the controller illegally processed the personal data of millions of users for telemarketing purposes. Namely, the call centers working for Fastweb largely acted in disregard of data protection regulations. They often used telephone numbers for their calls that were not registered in the Italian register for communications operators (Registro degli Operatori di Comunicazione). Moreover, they processed contact data for promotions Fastweb had received from external partners without the data subjects having given valid consent for their data to be shared. In addition, many users reported being contacted by 'self-proclaimed Fastweb operators' who attempted to obtain contractors' identity documents via WhatsApp, likely for the purpose of spamming, phishing and other fraudulent activities. Other breaches involved procedures for the 'call me back' service that made it impossible for users to give free, specific and informed consent and to deactivate the service in an automated manner. The Spanish DPA (AEPD) has fined Kukimbia S.L. EUR 3,000. The controller is a company that stores, transports and distributes goods. Documents containing personal data about the controller's customers and suppliers were found freely accessible next to a trash can near one of the controller's warehouses. The DPA determined that the controller had violated Art. 32 GDPR. The Spanish DPA (AEPD) has fined Electrotecnica Bastida S.L. EUR 3,000. Police officers had found 29 envelopes addressed to the controllers' respective employees on a vacant lot in the local industrial area. Two envelopes had already been opened. The envelopes contained results of medical examinations. The AEPD considered this to be a breach of the controller's duty to implement adequate technical and organizational measures to protect the processing of personal data. The Spanish DPA (AEPD) has imposed a fine of EUR 4,000 on Stockhunters S.L.. The controller was not able to answer the data subject's requests regarding the use of his personal data. In addition, the data protection policy of the controller's website did not comply with the provisions of Art. 13 GDPR. The data subject was therefore unsure of how his personal data was being used. \\xa0The Spanish DPA (AEPD) has fined Promotech Digital S.L. EUR 2,400 for repeatedly sending the data subject advertising SMS, even though he never subscribed or agreed to receive SMS. Furthermore, the SMS did not offer a direct option to unsubscribe from the advertising. Instead, reference was made to the possibility of cancellation by e-mail. Even though the data subject had objected to receiving further SMS, he continued to receive SMS from the controller. The original fine of EUR 3,000 was reduced by 20% to EUR 2,400 due to immediate payment and acknowledgement of guilt. The Italian DPA (Garante) has imposed a fine of EUR 45,000 on Istituti ospedalieri bergamaschi. The DPA initiated an investigation against the controller after it reported a data breach to the DPA. A patient had mistakenly received medical records and clinical documentation from seven other patients in his digital medical record. The Greek DPA (HDPA) has fined a parliamentary candidate EUR 2,000. The data subject had received a call from the controller on her private mobile number prior to the Greek parliamentary elections in July 2019. The call was made for the purpose of promoting the controller's candidacy. The data subject's inquiries regarding the use of her personal data were answered by the controller in a contradictory manner. The Norwegian DPA (Datatilsynet) has fined the municipality of Asker EUR 100,000. On May 20, 2020, the DPA received a notice that the municipality had unlawfully published personal data on its website. On the website, users could view the names of documents that had previously been sent via the municipality's email distribution list. In addition to the names of the actual document, they also contained the names and dates of birth of 127 people, including children. Although the distribution lists were proofread daily by two people, the municipality had failed to detect the discrepancies. The Norwegian DPA concludes that the data breach occurred partly due to a lack of required routines for handling email lists. The Italian DPA (Garante) has imposed a fine of EUR 6,000 on Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi for a breach of Art. 5 GDPR and Art. 9 GDPR. Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi had notified the DPA of a data breach under Art. 33 GDPR regarding the transfer of health data to the wrong person. Medical documents of a patient had been sent by mail both to the affected patient and to another patient. The controller states that the incident occurred due to an error in the printing process. The ward where the affected patient was treated was only equipped with two printers, and one doctor had unknowingly also taken a colleague's print job (the affected patient's documents) when taking out his print job (the documents of the wrong recipient). The Spanish DPA (AEPD) has imposed a fine of EUR 100,000 on Kutxabank, S.A.. Following a complaint from a former customer, claiming that the bank did not comply with his request to erasure of his data, the DPA started an investigation against the controller. The data subject had already been a customer of the bank in the past. At that time, he had exercised his right to erasure of his data. When he tried to open a new account with the controller, he was informed that this was not possible as his data was still blocked (due to his previous erasure request). The controller further informed the data subject that he would have to unblock the data if he wanted to open an account. For this purpose, a form was attached to the letter. The form stated that by signing it, the data subject was revoking his right to erasure and allowing his data to be used (again) by the controller. The DPA found that temporarily blocking the data, does not correspond to the right to erasure. The DPA also emphasized that deleted or blocked data may not be processed again when a new contractual relationship is entered into with the controller, even if the new processing purpose is the same as the previous one. The original fine of EUR 100,000 was reduced to EUR 60,000 euros due to the immediate payment and acknowledgement of guilt. The Czech DPA (UOOU) fined Mall.tv EUR 2,700 for recording parts of the public space without a legal basis. The subject of the DPA's investigation was the operation of two cameras by a company. The cameras recorded parts of the public space and then broadcast the footage in real time on internet television. The footage was of such high resolution that people and vehicles passing by were clearly visible and identifiable. The Romanian DPA (ANSPDCP) has fined S.C. Tip Top Food Industry S.R.L. EUR 5,000. The controller had installed several video cameras in the food areas and changing rooms to surveil its employees. The CCTV was intended to deter theft and protect the manufactured goods. The Romanian DPA stated that the controller violated the principle of data minimization, as such extensive surveillance was not necessary. The goods produced could had been protected by methods less intrusive to the privacy of the employees. The Hellenic DPA (HDPA) has imposed a fine of EUR 2,000 on Ιγνατιάδης Νικόλαος και ΣΙΑ Ε.Ε. The controller had installed surveillance cameras covering areas where its employees were present. The controller claims that the cameras were installed for security purposes, as there had been incidents of theft in the past. Considering this, the surveillance system was intended to detect people entering the facilities. However, during the DPA's investigation, it was found that the camera installation was not limited to areas necessary for the protection of property. The DPA recognized this as a violation of the principle of data minimization. The Spanish DPA (AEPD) has imposed a fine of EUR 3,000 on a private individual. The controller resides on the 1st floor of an apartment building, where he is the owner of apartments on the 2nd and 3rd floors. He regularly rents out these apartments to tourists. The controller had installed four video cameras on the three floors and in the entrance area of the building. He justified their operation with security concerns related to the rental to tourists. The owners' association had not granted permission for the operation of the cameras. Also, the controller did not put up a sign in the building informing about the operation of the camera. The DPA found this to be a violation of the principle of data minimization, as the cameras covered areas of the building used by the community, whose monitoring was not necessary for the protection of the controller's property. Furthermore, the controller violated its obligation to provide information, as he failed to inform the other residents of the building about the processing of their data. The Spanish DPA (AEPD) has imposed a fine of EUR 150,000 on Vodafone España S.A.U.. Three data subjects had filed complaints with the AEPD against the controller. They complained about receiving unsolicited text messages from the controller informing them of new invoices, even though there was no longer a contractual relationship between them and the controller. Moreover, there were no outstanding invoices, as the amount to be paid was always zero euros. The data subjects had asked the controller several times to stop sending them text messages and to delete their data. The controller had explained that the messages had been sent due to a technical error and assured the data subjects that they would no longer receive such notifications in the future. However, the sending continued. The original fine of EUR 150,000 was reduced to EUR 90,000 due to immediate payment and admission of guilt. The Romanian DPA (ANSPDCP) has imposed a fine of EUR 1,500 on Lugera & Makler Broker S.R.L.. The controller had accidentally destroyed data of customers of Raiffeisen Bank S.A., for which it acted as processor. The ANSPDCP states that the incident occurred due to the fact that the controller had not taken sufficient technical and organizational measures to ensure an adequate level of protection of the data processing. \\xa0The Spanish DPA (AEPD) fined the owner of a pub EUR 1,500 due to the unauthorized use of two video surveillance cameras covering parts of the public space.  The Czech DPA (UOOU) conducted an investigation against the operator of a non-governmental medical facility following a security breach. The operator offers a range of diagnostic tests to patients. The results of the tests are subsequently communicated on its website to both patients and physicians who recommended the tests. The reported security breach involved an attack on the operator's website by an unknown individual. Following this incident, the operator stopped operating the website in question and proposed technical measures to increase security. However, the DPA still found that other websites operated by the same operator had the same shortcomings. Yet, the operator did not restrict their operation nor did it take any new technical measures. As a consequence, the UOOU imposed a fine of EUR 387. A person had received an invoice for ordered goods, which, however, came from a different company than the one from which she had ordered the goods. Therefore, the data subject contacted the company that had supplied the goods and requested information about where her personal data had been obtained from, how it had been processed and on what legal basis it had been processed. As the company did not respond to her request, the data subject contacted the DPA. The DPA then demanded the controller to provide the data subject with the requested information immediately. As the controller did not respond to this request either, the DPA imposed a fine in the amount of EUR 1,900. The Norwegian DPA (Datatilsynet) has imposed a fine of EUR 19,900 on Basaren Drift AS. The controller had installed video cameras in its premises which recorded both its employees and customers.

In addition, the Norwegian DPA found that the controller did not provide sufficient information on the surveillance to the data subjects. The Spanish DPA (AEPD) has imposed a fine of EUR 1,500 on a private individual. The controller had installed a surveillance camera on his property, which recorded, among other things, the public space and neighboring properties. According to the controller, he had installed the camera for security purposes regarding his property. The AEPD considered this to be a violation of the principle of data minimization, as such extensive monitoring was not necessary to protect the controller's property The Italian DPA (Garante) has imposed a fine of EUR 6,000 on Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi for a breach of Art. 5 GDPR and Art. 9 GDPR. Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi had notified the DPA of a data breach under Art. 33 GDPR regarding the transfer of health data to the wrong person. Medical documents of a patient had been sent by mail both to the affected patient and to another patient. The controller states that the incident occurred due to an error in the printing process. The ward where the affected patient was treated was only equipped with two printers, and one doctor had unknowingly also taken a colleague's print job (the affected patient's documents) when taking out his print job (the documents of the wrong recipient). The Greek DPA (HDPA) has fined a parliamentary candidate EUR 2,000. The data subject had received a call from the controller on her private mobile number prior to the Greek parliamentary elections in July 2019.

The data subject's inquiries regarding the use of her personal data were answered by the controller in a contradictory manner. \\xa0The Italian DPA (Garante) has imposed a fine of EUR 3,000 on the municipality of San Marco in Lamis. The municipality had uploaded documents containing personal data of the data subject and his family freely accessible on its website. The documents were two orders against the data subject. The documents were related to a proceeding against the data subject concerning construction activities without a building permit and contained the date of birth, place of birth, tax number and address of the data subject and his relatives. The data subject had already asked the municipality in advance to remove the documents from the website. However, the municipality did not comply. A company stored biometric signatures of its customers, which violated the principle of data minimization. The Spanish DPA (AEPD) has imposed a fine of EUR 5,000 on Pagamastarde S.L.. A data subject had filed a complaint with the AEPD against the controller due to the fact that the controller continued to send him SMS advertisements, despite the fact that he had requested the deletion of his data and the controller had confirmed the deletion. The controller stated that the data subject's request had not been fulfilled due to a human error. The fine is composed proportionately of EUR 3,000 for a violation of Art. 17 (1) GDPR and EUR 2,000 for a violation of Art. 21 LSSI. The original fine of EUR 5,000 was reduced to EUR 3,000 due to immediate payment and admission of guilt.  The Spanish DPA (AEPD) has imposed a fine of EUR 15,000 on Anytime Fitness Iberia S.L.. A data subject had filed a complaint with the AEPD against the controller due to the fact that the controller continued to send him SMS advertisements, despite the fact that he had requested the deletion of his data and the controller had confirmed the deletion. The fine is composed proportionally of EUR 10,000 for a breach of Art. 17 GDPR and EUR 5,000 for a breach of Art. 21 LSSI. The Dutch DPA (AP) has fined the municipality of Enschede EUR 600,000. In 2017, the municipality decided to install special measurement boxes to measure crowds in the city center of Enschede. Sensors in the measurement boxes detected the wifi signals from the cell phones of passers-by and registered them with a code. Based on the registered codes, it was possible to calculate how busy the city center was. However, this also made it possible to track which measurement box a particular cell phone passed by, making it possible to track the movement of passers-by. The municipality states that it was never its intention to track passers-by. However, the DPA finds that the wifi tracking (even if it was unintentional) constitutes a serious breach of the GDPR. The DPA concludes that the municipality tracked its passers-by without an effective legal basis and thus violated Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR and Art. 6 (1) GDPR. The Italian DPA (Garante) has imposed a fine of EUR 15,000 on Mediacom s.r.l.. The controller carried out advertising calls on behalf of TIM s.p.a.. Several of the calls were made even though the data subjects had not consented, had objected to the advertising calls, or had their numbers on the Robinson list. Garante found that the controller failed to verify the legitimacy of the data in contact lists acquired from third-party companies, as well as to sufficiently ensure that valid consents had been given by the data subjects for corresponding promotional activities. \\xa0The Italian DPA (Garante) has imposed a fine of EUR 80,000 on Planet Group Spa. The controller made promotional calls on behalf of TIM s.p.a.. Several of these calls were made even though the data subjects had not consented or had objected to the calls. Garante found that the controller had contacted a total of 47,981 telephone numbers without consent or legal basis. In addition, Garante highlighted that the controller had not respected the data subjects' right to object. In one case, a user had been contacted 155 times in one month, even though he had exercised his right to object. The Italian DPA (Garante) has imposed a fine of EUR 30,000 on OneDirect Srl. A data subject had filed two complaints with the DPA after receiving advertisements by e-mail from the controller, even though he had not consented to it. Even after the data subject had repeatedly objected to the sending, the controller had not stopped the mailings. Moreover, the controller did not respond to the data subject's objections. Furthermore, the controller did not maintain a register of its processing activities and had not sufficiently cooperated with the DPA in the course of the investigation. The Belgian DPA (APD) has imposed a fine of EUR 100,000 on a financial company. A data subject had filed two complaints with the APD against the company. They were based on 20 queries of her personal data from the credit register of the National Bank of Belgium. The controller employs the data subject's ex-husband, who allegedly used his role to unlawfully gain access to the register in order to obtain financial information about the data subject and thus gain an advantage in their divorce proceedings. As the DPA noted, the data protection violations occurred due to the fact that the controller had not taken adequate organizational measures to protect personal data from unauthorized processing. \\xa0The Finnish DPA has imposed a fine of EUR 75,000 on ParkkiPate Oy. A number of people had been issued parking tickets by the controller and had thereupon requested information about which personal data was being processed and, in some cases, requested the deletion of their data. However, in order to process the requests, the controller stated that it needed the ID card number and address of the data subjects for identification purposes, as their name with the parking ticket number was not sufficient to verify their identity. According to the DPA, the controller has not only violated its duty to inform the data subjects and the right to delete their data, but has also violated the principle of data minimization. The DPA stressed that it is permitted to request further proof of identification if there are reasonable doubts about the identity of the data subject. However, in the cases in question, no such doubts had existed. Furthermore, the DPA found a violation of the principle of storage limitation. The controller had stored photos of incorrectly parked cars and copies of parking tickets for possible future disputes in court without having defined a deadline for the deletion of the data. The Hungarian DPA (NAIH) has fined the XI District Office of the Government of Budapest EUR 27,700.The controller had emailed health data regarding Covid-19 rapid tests, as well as the contact details of the people tested, to doctors in a single Excel file, unencrypted and without any further measures to ensure confidentiality. The DPA found that the controller had failed to implement technical and organizational measures that ensured the protection of personal data. In addition, the controller failed to inform the DPA and the data subjects about the data violations. On May 5, 2021, the Norwegian DPA (Datatilsynet) announced that it intents to fine Disqus Inc. EUR 2, 500, 000 for violations of Art. 5 (1), (2) GDPR, Art. 6 GDPR, Art. 12 GDPR and Art. 13 GDPR.

The Icelandic DPA (Persónuvernd) has imposed a fine of EUR 23,100 on InfoMentor ehf. Previously, the controller had reported a data breach according to Art. 33 GDPR. The incident concerned the company's online system, which is mainly used by schools and other institutions for communication and information purposes. In the course of its investigations, the DPA determined that inadequate technical and organizational security measures on the part of the controller led to the breach. Due to a security leak that resulted in the six-digit system number of each user being visible in the URL address of a specific page within the mentor system, unauthorized persons gained access to the personal data of 424 children. The Dutch DPA (AP) fined the Overijssel local branch of the PVV party EUR 7,500 for failing to notify the AP of a personal data breach, in violation of Art. 33 GDPR. An email regarding the convening of a meeting had been sent via an open distribution list due to a human error. Since the total of 101 recipients were addressed as 'Friends of the PVV' in the email, the political beliefs of the data subjects were thus disclosed to all addressees.  The Spanish DPA (AEPD) has imposed a fine of EUR 3,000 on Solram T Y R S.L..

Both the residents of the facility and the employees were recorded by the video surveillance. The controller states that the cameras were installed for security purposes. These included preventing unauthorized persons from gaining access to the facility and deterring theft. The DPA states that such extensive video surveillance was not necessary for the processing purpose (security of the facility). Furthermore, the controller did not sufficiently inform the data subjects about the data processing. The Hellenic DPA has fined A. ΕΠΙΛΟΓΗ ΙΔΙΩΤΙΚΗ ΚΕΦΑΛΑΙΟΥΧΙΚΗ ΕΤΑΙΡΕΙΑ EUR 5,000. The controller had not responded to requests for information and deletion from the data subject. During the DPA´s investigation, the controller informed the DPA that it had deleted the data of the data subject. However, the data subject had not been informed of this. Furthermore, the DPA determined that the data subject's data had been collected for a purpose other than the agreed purpose. A corresponding consent of the data subject for this new processing purpose had not been obtained. The Polish DPA (UODO) has fined Cyfrowy Polsat S.A. EUR 245,000. The fine was based on a large number of data breaches reported by the controller to the DPA. Frequently, postal correspondence containing personal data was lost or delivered to the wrong recipient. The DPA notes that although the data breaches were caused by the courier company contracted by the controller, the controller had to ensure that such breaches did not occur. The controller failed to implement technical and organizational measures appropriate to the risk to protect the processing of the data. Furthermore, the controller did not notify the data subjects about the data breaches until two to three months later. The Italian DPA (Garante) has imposed a fine of EUR 2,000 on Società triveneta di chirurgia.

A data subject had filed a complaint with the Italian DPA against the municipality of Palermo. His complaint was based on the fact that his personal data from a food subsidy application he had submitted had been acquired by an unauthorized person and processed for his own purposes. As the DPA determined in the course of its investigations, such processing had occurred because the municipality had not implemented adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security and confidentiality of the processing. The Dutch DPA (AP) has imposed a fine of EUR 15,000 on CP&A. The controller had documented both the causes of illness and specific complaints of the data subjects as part of the recording of employee absences due to illness. The DPA found that this was unlawful since health data is granted special protection. Employers are not permitted to record either the reasons or causes of sick leave. Furthermore, the DPA found that the controller had not implemented adequate technical and organizational measures to protect the processing when recording absences. Namely, the absence registration was accessible online, without any form of authentication. Yet, when an absence system is accessible via the Internet, the system is to be accessed only through a multi-factor authentication. In the DPA's view, another form of authentication would have been required in addition to the 'normal' login. \\xa0The Norwegian DPA (Datatilsynet) has imposed a fine of EUR 39,000 on the Municipality of Oslo. On a website of the controller a subpoena from the public prosecutor's office concerning the data subject had been published.

The incident occurred because the subpoena was not originally classified as confidential and accordingly was not exempted from public disclosure. The document was publicly available for five hours before it was removed. The Irish DPA (DPC) has imposed a fine of EUR 90,000 on Irish Credit Bureau (ICB). The fine follows a data breach reported by the controller to the DPA on August 31, 2018. The controller is a credit reporting agency that maintains a database of credit contract performance between financial institutions and borrowers.

As a result, between June 28, 2018 and August 30, 2018, the ICB database inaccurately updated the records of 15,120 closed accounts. The controller disclosed 1,062 inaccurate account records to financial institutions or affected individuals before the issue was resolved. The Hungarian DPA (NAIH) has imposed a fine of EUR 1,400 on a company. In the course of his professional activities, a data subject had made a telephone call to the controller on September 23, 2019. The controller had recorded the conversation without informing the data subject or obtaining his consent and then provided it to the company where the data subject was employed. The employer of the data subject subsequently terminated his employment because the recorded telephone call apparently did not meet the company's service and professional standards. The DPA finds that the controller not only processed the data subject's data without a legal basis, but also breached its accountability obligation by failing to demonstrate the lawfulness of the processing. In addition, the controller violated its duty to provide information under Art. 13 GDPR. The Hungarian DPA (NAIH) has imposed a fine of EUR 570 on a company. In the course of his professional activities, a data subject had made a telephone call to a company on September 23, 2019.

The controller then terminated the employment relationship because the recorded telephone conversation apparently did not meet the controller's service and professional standards. The DPA finds that the controller not only processed the data subject's data without a legal basis, but also breached its accountability obligations by failing to demonstrate the lawfulness of the processing. In addition, the controller violated its obligation to provide information pursuant to Art. 13 GDPR. The Spanish DPA (AEPD) has imposed a fine of EUR 100,000 on Vodafone España, S.A.U..

According to the complaint, the data subject had received an advertising call from a company, which was made on behalf of Vodafone España, S.A.U., although the data subject was registered in the Robinson advertising exclusion list. According to Vodafone's commissioned processor, the advertising call to the data subject had occurred due to an error in the call number filtering system. In the course of its investigation, the DPA found that Vodafone had not established any measures to avoid advertising calls to numbers on the Robinson list. In the present case, Vodafone had not even been aware that the number of the data subject was on the Robinson list, which meant that it was not blocked for the commissioned company. The Spanish DPA (AEPD) has fined Alava Norte, S.L. EUR 4,000. The controller had installed three 360° video surveillance cameras on the facade of one of its buildings to secure the facility. These also captured parts of the public space.

The Italian DPA (Garante) has imposed a fine of EUR 12,000 on the Italian National Institute for Social Security (Istituto Nazionale della Previdenza Sociale). That fine was based on the fact that the controller failed to respond properly to two requests for information that the data subject had submitted to the controller. The requests were related to the disclosure of personal data of the data subject to third parties. Initially, the data subject had received no response to either request. In the course of the investigation, the controller then provided him with information and explained that the previous requests had not been answered due to a technical error in its e-mail system Video surveillance of public space and thus violation of the principle of data minimization. Furthermore: Violation of information obligations, as insufficient information has been provided about video surveillance. The Hellenic DPA has imposed a fine of EUR 5,000 on ΚARIERA A.E.. A data subject had filed a complaint with the DPA against the controller due to the fact that the controller continued to send him e-mail advertisements even though he had requested the deletion of his data and the controller had confirmed the deletion.

In the course of the investigation, the controller then provided him with information and explained that the previous requests had not been answered due to a technical error in its e-mail system The DPA from Luxembourg (CNPD) has imposed a fine of EUR 1,900 on a company. The controller had installed a video surveillance system to protect the company's assets and prevent entry by unauthorized persons. However, the cameras also excessively captured parts of the public space. The DPA finds that the controller thus violated the principle of data minimization under Article 5 (1) c) GDPR. In addition, the DPA finds that the controller stored the recordings longer than legally permitted and thus violated Art. 5 (1) e) GDPR.  The Swedish DPA has imposed a fine of EUR 25,000 on Region Sörmland. The fine is related to an investigation against three companies and three Swedish regions. In all 21 regions of Sweden, a telephone hotline that offers advice on various health-related topics can be reached by dialing 1177. Each region operates its own health advice service, either internally or through contracted subcontractors, but together they form a national network. In 2019, the media reported that recorded calls to the 1177 helpline were available on a web server without password protection or other security measures. All calls to the 1177 number initially went to the company Inera, which managed and developed the shared systems. Calls to the number 1177 from people living in the Stockholm, Sörmland and Värmland regions were put through by Inera to Medhelp AB, which took the calls. Medhelp had in turn contracted the Thai company Medicall Co Ltd. to take calls on weekends and at night. Both Medhelp and Medicall had a contract with the technology company Voice Integrate Nordic AB for, among other things, call recordings. A data breach had then occurred in which recordings of calls to the number 1177 were available on the Internet on a storage server belonging to Voice Integrate. The incident resulted from the misconfiguration of a network-attached storage device that was publicly accessible over the Internet and did not use encrypted communications. A large number of calls were accessed due to the vulnerability. The DPA imposed the fine on Region Sörmland for collecting call data from data subjects without first properly informing them of its processing.

The incident resulted from the misconfiguration of a network-attached storage device that was publicly accessible over the Internet and did not use encrypted communications. A large number of calls were accessed due to the vulnerability. The Swedish DPA found that MedHelp had failed to take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure an adequate level of security to protect personal data so that unauthorized persons could not access it. Similarly, MedHelp had failed to properly inform callers about the processing of their personal data in accordance with Art. 13 GDPR. In addition, the DPA finds the outsourcing of the processing of personal data to Medicall to be a breach of the legality principle set out in the GDPR. This is because Medicall is not covered by Swedish health and medical legislation and is therefore not subject to the legally regulated confidentiality obligation that exists in the Swedish healthcare sector. The Swedish DPA has imposed a fine of EUR 64,500 on Voice Integrate Nordic AB. The fine is related to an investigation against three companies and three Swedish regions.

Calls to the number 1177 from people living in the Stockholm, Sörmland and Värmland regions were put through by Inera to Medhelp AB, which took the calls. Medhelp had in turn contracted the Thai company Medicall Co Ltd. to take calls on weekends and at night. Both Medhelp and Medicall had a contract with the technology company Voice Integrate Nordic AB for, among other things, call recordings. A data breach had then occurred in which recordings of calls to the number 1177 were available on the Internet on a storage server belonging to Voice Integrate. The incident resulted from the misconfiguration of a network-attached storage device that was publicly accessible over the Internet and did not use encrypted communications. A large number of calls were accessed due to the vulnerability. The Swedish DPA found that Voice Integrate had failed to take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure an adequate level of security to protect personal data so that unauthorized persons could not access it. The Norwegian DPA (Datatilsynet) has imposed a fine of EUR 39,700 on BRAbank ASA. The controller had reported a data breach to the DPA on September 6, 2019. On the controller's website, some customers were able to view other customers' data on the 'My Page' section. These included credit terms and address information of other customers. The section had been activated shortly before for 500 selected customers and was intended, among other things, to provide an overview of loans taken out with the controller. Based on investigations into the case, the DPA found that the controller had not complied with the GDPR's requirements for risk assessment and appropriate technical measures in connection with the launch of the customer portal. According to the DPA's assessment, the personal data security breach could have been prevented if the controller had conducted a risk assessment and review as required by law. The Dutch DPA (AP) has fined an orthodontic clinic EUR 12,000. The web form that new patients used to sign up contained mandatory fields for all sorts of patient personal data. The data that the patients (mostly children) entered into the form was then sent to the orthodontic clinic via an unencrypted - and thus unsecured - connection. This presented the risk of unauthorized third parties accessing the personal data of the data subjects. The Danish DPA (Datatilsynet) has imposed a fine of EUR 27,000 on Vejle municipality. The Danish DPA had started investigations against the municipality after it had reported a data breach pursuant to Art. 33 GDPR. The municipal dental care service had sent automated welcome letters to both parents as part of the treatment of children, which contained the contact details of both parents. In this process, the municipality had not checked whether it was permitted to pass the information on to the other parent. In several cases, parents thus received the address of the other parent, regardless of whether the other parent had name and address protection. The DPA considered this to be a failure of the municipality to take technical and organizational measures to ensure adequate data protection. The Swedish DPA has fined Storstockholms Lokaltrafik (Stockholm Local Transport Company) EUR 1,600,000. The controller had equipped ticket inspectors with body-worn cameras, which were designed to prevent threatening situations, document incidents, and ensure that the right person was fined for traveling on Stockholm's public transportation without a valid ticket. Ticket inspectors were required to keep the camera on for their entire shift and were therefore able to film all passengers who passed the inspector. Since several hundred thousand people use public transportation in Stockholm every day, a large number of people were thus at risk of being monitored by video and audio recordings. The DPA believes that body-worn camera technology could be used to prevent and document threatening situations, but that the pre-recording time should be reduced to a maximum of 15 seconds, as a longer pre-recording time is not necessary to achieve the above-mentioned purposes. Furthermore the DPA found that audio recordings did not contribute to the identification of persons without a valid ticket. The DPA therefore considered the audio recordings to be a violation of the principles of legality and transparency as well as data minimization. The DPA also criticized the controller for not providing sufficient information about the camera surveillance, including the fact that not only images but also sounds were recorded. The French DPA (CNIL) has imposed a fine of EUR 500,000 on BRICO PRIVÉ. CNIL conducted three inspections at BRICO PRIVÉ between 2018 and 2021 and identified several deficiencies in the processing of personal data of prospects and customers. The controller, for example, had not complied with the data retention periods it had established. In this regard the data of more than 16,000 customers who had not placed an order in the last five years had been retained. The same applied to more than 130,000 people who had not logged into their customer accounts for five years. In addition, the controller violated its information obligations under Art. 13 GDPR. Furthermore, the controller failed to fulfill its obligation to fully comply with the deletion requests received. The CNIL also found that the controller did not implement sufficient technical and organizational measures to ensure information security. Thus, for example, the controller did not require the use of a secure password during the process of opening an account the company´s website or when employees accessed the customer relationship management software. The fine is composed proportionately of EUR 300,000 for violations of Art. 5(1) e) GDPR, Art. 13 GDPR, Art. 17 GDPR and Art. 32 GDPR and EUR 200,000 for violations of Art. 82 Loi informatique et libertés and Art. L. 34-5 CPCE. The Spanish DPA (AEPD) has imposed a fine of EUR 10,000 on TNT EXPRESS WORLDWIDE SPAIN, S.L.. The data subject had placed a private order with the controller and had entered the address of his workplace as the delivery address. The delivery was correctly delivered, but the invoice was issued to the company where the data subject was employed and not to the data subject. Both the invoice and the delivery bill contained various personal data of the data subject. These were disclosed to his employer as a result of the incident.  The Norwegian DPA (Datatilsynet) has fined the municipality of Moss EUR 49,200 for inadequately securing personal data. In January, the municipality of Rygge was annexed to the municipality of Moss. For this reason, several IT systems from both municipalities were combined. Due to inadequate security measures, a data breach occurred in a productive system used in the municipality's health service. This system processed personal and health data and affected people who live in the municipality and use the health center. The system is used for services related to immunization programs in the municipality, as well as for other health checks and follow-ups of pregnant women. About 2000 people were potentially affected by the breach Due to the data breach, errors had occurred in vaccine registration. As a result, the data subjects were at risk of receiving the wrong vaccines. There was also a potential for their immunization data to be misfiled in the national immunization registry. Furthermore, errors occurred in follow-ups for pregnant women, including information on the week of pregnancy or the mother's drug use. Also, patient information was provided to health workers in a health service ward without being required and without access being documented. The DPA from Luxembourg (CNPD) has imposed a fine of EUR 2,800 on a company. The controller had installed location sensors on a number of cars in its fleet. The purpose of this was to protect the company's assets, monitor the transport of goods and the drivers' working hours, among other things. Some of the location data collected by the controller was stored for two years and four months. The DPA states that this was clearly excessive and not necessary for the purposes of the processing. The DPA considered this to be a violation of the principle of storage limitation. In addition, the DPA found that the controller had not sufficiently informed the data subjects about the processing of the location data and had thus violated its information obligations pursuant to Art. 13 GDPR.  The Italian DPA (Garante) has fined Foodinho s.r.l. EUR 2,600,000. Foodinho is an Italian food delivery service. The investigation against Foodinho mainly focused on the drivers of Foodinho. In the process, the DPA found some serious violations of applicable data protection regulations. Thus, the DPA identified some irregularities concerning the algorithms of the Foodinho system. In particular, the DPA found that the controller had not adequately informed employees about how the system worked and did not guarantee the accuracy and correctness of the results of the algorithms used to evaluate drivers. Furthermore, the DPA found violations of the principles of data minimization as well as memory limitation. For example, the systems processed drivers' data to an extent that exceeded the purpose of the processing and, in some cases, stored the data significantly longer than necessary. In addition, the controller had not taken sufficient technical and organizational measures to ensure secure data processing. The controller had also not conducted a data protection impact assessment, although this would have been necessary due to the considerable amount of data of different types relating to a significant number of data subjects. Separate proceedings are being conducted against the parent company GlovoApp23 by the Spanish DPA (AEPD). A Croatian IT company provides IT services to entities such as mobile operators, banks and state institutions in Croatia, as well as to companies abroad (USA, Great Britain, the Netherlands, etc.), thereby acting as a data processor in relation to personal data. The data controller, a telecommunications company using the services of the IT provider, informed the DPA as well its users of the potential breach of personal data by the IT provider. The incident consisted of a security breach which led to unauthorized access and processing of personal data by hackers and involved personal data of 28,085 respondents. The incident occurred because the IT provider had not taken the necessary measures to achieve an adequate level of security in accordance with existing and foreseeable risks. The IT provider, as a data processor, was obliged to take appropriate technical security measures in such a way as to ensure the permanent confidentiality of the system, including regular testing, evaluation and assessment of the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures to ensure security of processing. When assessing the appropriate level of security, the IT provider should have taken particular account of the risks of unauthorized disclosure of personal data. Due to failure to take appropriate technical measures for the security of personal data processing, the DPA imposed an administrative fine on the IT provider. The amount of the fine is unknown at the moment. In its decision, the DPA took into account the nature of the IT provider’s business activity, whose role should be to support other entities through opinions and guidelines, proposing solutions for the implementation of web applications, and especially designing and implementing appropriate technical measures. The Italian DPA (Garante) has fined the municipality of Bolzano EUR 84,000. A former employee of the municipality filed a complaint with the DPA against the municipality. In particular, the former employee complained that the municipality processed personal data related to his internet use during working hours and that he later received a notice of initiation of disciplinary proceedings accusing him of accessing Facebook for more than 40 minutes and YouTube for more than 3 hours during his working hours and of using the municipality's computer for private purposes. The DPA's investigation revealed that the municipality had been using a system to control and filter employees' internet browsing for about a decade, with monthly retention of data and creation of special reports for network security purposes. The system also collected information that had nothing to do with professional activities and, in any case, concerned the private life of the person in question. The DPA finds that the controller thus violated the principle of data minimization, lawfulness and purpose limitation. The controller should rather have taken less intrusive measures to prevent the private use of the Internet. The DPA pointed out that the need to reduce the risk of misuse of Internet navigation cannot lead to the complete elimination of any privacy of the data subject at the workplace, even in cases where the employee uses network services provided by the employer. In addition, the controller had not adequately informed employees about the collection of Internet history, in violation of its obligation under Article 13 of the GDPR. Furthermore, the investigation identified other violations in the processing of data related to employees' requests for extraordinary medical examinations, which were made using a special form. The form provided by the controller had to be checked by the head of the organizational unit, a circumstance that led to the unlawful processing of health data. The DPA from Luxembourg (CNPD) has imposed a fine of EUR 7,200 on a company. The company had installed a video surveillance system to protect the company's assets, prevent intrusion by unauthorized persons and prevent accidents. However, the cameras also captured parts of an employee's work area and the smoking area that employees frequently used. Furthermore, the controller had installed location sensors on the cars in its fleet. This was intended to optimize the company's operations. The DPA finds that the recording of employees was not necessary to ensure the purposes associated with the video surveillance and was therefore disproportionate. The DPA states that the controller thus violated the principle of data minimization under Article 5 (1) c) of the GDPR. The location data collected by the controller was stored for a period of eight months, although this would not have been necessary for the purposes of the processing. The DPA considered this to be a violation of the principle of data retention. Furthermore, the DPA found a violation of the information obligations set out in Art. 13 GDPR. Finally, the DPA found a violation of Art. 32 (1) GDPR. All persons who had authorized access to the software via which the locations could be tracked used the same account and not an individual account. The Dutch DPA (AP) has fined UWV (the Dutch employee insurance service provider - 'Uitvoeringsinstituut Werknemersverzekeringen) EUR 450,000. The UWV had not properly secured the sending of group messages via the 'My Workbook' environment. This is a personal environment on the UWV website where job seekers have contact with the UWV. As a result, there were multiple data leaks of personal information, including health information, from a total of more than 15,000 individuals. The ICO has fined transgender charity Mermaids EUR 29,000 for failing to protect the personal data of its users, in breach of Art. 5 (1) f) UK GPDR and Art. 32 (1), (2) UK GDPR. The ICO conducted an investigation after it received a report of a data breach relating to an internal email group. During the investigation, the ICO found that the group was created with insufficiently secure settings, resulting in approximately 780 pages of confidential emails being viewable online for nearly three years. This resulted in personal information, such as names and email addresses, of 550 people being online. The ICO concludes that Mermaids should have restricted access to its email group and could have considered pseudonymization or encryption to provide additional protection for the personal data. Organizations responsible for personal data must ensure that they take the appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of personal data. The Danish DPA (Datatilsynet) has fined Medicals Nordic I/S EUR 80,700. In January 2021, the DPA became aware that Medicals Nordic was using WhatsApp to transmit confidential information and health data about citizens being tested in the company's test centres. All employees working in a test centre were invited to a WhatsApp group associated with the test centre. The members of these WhatsApp groups received all the messages transmitted by other employees in the groups. The employees shared confidential information about citizens to the company's central administration through those WhatsApp groups. This meant that employees who, did not have a work-related need to process information - which other employees had to transmit to the central administration - nevertheless received the information, which included, inter alia, personal identity numbers and health data of citizens. The Danish DPA (Datatilsynet) has fined the Region of Syddanmark EUR 67,900 for failing to comply with its obligation as a data controller to implement adequate security measures. The matter came to the attention of the DPA when a citizen complained to the authority in 2020 about the lack of security in the processing of personal data of the citizen's child by the region, and shortly thereafter the region reported the matter to the authority as a personal data breach. The Region of Syddanmark had maintained a database for research and clinical purposes for a period of more than 1.5 years, whereby the database was not adequately secured against unauthorized access. By manipulating URLs, it was possible to gain access to PDF documents stored in the database. This allowed citizens who were registered in the database - and who also had a login to the database - to access the personal data of people registered in the database. The database contained questionnaires with health information on more than 30,000 children receiving psychiatric care. The Spanish DPA (AEPD) has imposed a fine of Euro 6,000 on a private individual. On July 8, 2020, the DPA became aware of the dissemination on social networks of a video showing images of aggression by a man against a woman, as well as a young male minor intervening in the scene and trying to prevent the aggression that was taking place. However, the faces of the woman and the minor had not been pixelated. The original fine of EUR 10,000 was reduced to EUR 6,000 due to timely payment and admission of guilt. The Dutch DPA (AP) has fined the video portal TikTok EUR 750,000 for violating the privacy of young children. The information that Dutch users - mostly young children - received from TikTok when installing and using the app was in English and therefore not easy to understand. By not providing the privacy policy in Dutch, TikTok did not adequately explain how the app collects, processes, and reuses personal data. The DPA considered this to be a violation of the company's duty to provide information. The French DPA (CNIL) has fined private insurer SGAM AG2R LA MONDIALE EUR 1,750,000. The CNIL had carried out an inspection at the AG2R LA MONDIALE group in 2019. On this occasion, the CNIL found that the controller kept the data of millions of individuals for an excessive period of time and did not comply with their information obligations in the context of telephone canvassing campaigns. With regard to the data of prospects, the controller did not comply with the maximum retention period of three years defined in the reference framework and in the Group's processing register. As a result, the controller retained the data of nearly 2,000 customers who had not been in contact with the controller for more than three years, and in some cases five years. In relation to customer data, the controller did not comply with the maximum statutory retention periods stipulated in the Insurance Code and the Commercial Code. In this case, the controller retained the data of more than 2 million customers, some of which were sensitive (health) or specific (banking data), beyond the legally permitted retention periods after the end of the contract. The Italian DPA (Garante) has fined Azienda Usl della Romagna EUR 120,000. The local health authority of Romagna had accidentally transmitted a patient's report regarding an abortion to a general practitioner. However, the patient had asked not to inform her general practitioner about it. The transmission of the report was made through the regional network 'Sole'. The investigation by Garante revealed that the data had been accidentally transmitted due to an error in the software that manages patient admissions, discharges and transfers. The Italian DPA (Garante) has fined Azienda Provinciale per i Servizi Sanitari di Trento EUR 150,000. The controller had accidentally forwarded 293 medical reports of 175 patients to their general practitioners, even though the patients had asked not to forward the reports to their general practitioners. Among the patients in question had been two minors and several women who had undergone abortions. The investigation by Garante found that the data had been accidentally transmitted due to an error in the software that manages patient reports. The French DPA (CNIL) has fined MONSANTO EUR 400,000. In May 2019, several media revealed that MONSANTO was in possession of a file containing the personal data of more than 200 political figures or members of civil society (e.g. journalists, environmental activists, scientists or farmers) likely to influence the debate or public opinion on the renewal of the authorization of glyphosate in Europe. At the same time, the CNIL received seven complaints from data subjects affected by this file. For each of these individuals, the file contained information such as the organization they belonged to, the position they held, their business address, their business phone number, their cell phone number, their business email address, and in some cases their Twitter account. In addition, CNIL noted that each person was assigned a score from 1 to 5 to evaluate their influence, credibility, and support for Monsanto on various issues. The DPA believes that the company violated the provisions of the GDPR by not informing the data subjects that their data was stored in this file. In addition, the CNIL complained that the company had not given the contractual guarantees that should normally regulate the relationship with a subcontractor. The creation of contact files by stakeholders for lobbying purposes is not illegal in itself. However, CNIL stressed that data subjects nevertheless have the right to be informed of the existence of the file in order to exercise additional rights, in particular the right to object. In addition, the CNIL found that the data collection was carried out by a provider contracted by Monsanto and that Monsanto violated Article 28 of the General Data Protection Regulation by not including in its contracts with the data processor the provisions foreseen in the GDPR, in particular regarding data security.  The Spanish DPA (AEPD) has fined Mercadona S.A. EUR 2,520,000. The controller had installed facial recognition systems in Mercadona stores for the purpose of tracking individuals with criminal convictions or restraining orders. The system captured everyone who entered the stores, including minors and MERCADONA employees. During its investigation, the DPA found numerous privacy violations. For instance, the system violated the principle of data minimization, the principle of necessity and proportionality since the controller could process multiple biometric data - beyond the purpose of the system. In addition, the DPA concluded that Mercadona's privacy impact assessment was deficient as it did not take into account the specific and unique risks to Mercadona's employees posed by data processing through facial recognition systems. Furthermore, MERCADONA had violated its duty to inform according by not properly providing data subjects with information about the processing of their personal data. The original fine of EUR 3,150,000 consisted of EUR 500,000 due to a violation of Art. 5(1)(c), EUR 2,000,000 due to a violation of Art. 6 and Art. 9 of the GDPR, EUR 100,000 due to a violation of Art. 12 and Art. 13 of the GDPR, EUR 500,000 due to a violation of Art. 25(1) of the GDPR, and EUR 50,000 due to a violation of Art. 35 of the GDPR. The original fine was reduced to EUR 2,250,000 due to voluntary payment.  In its quarterly report, Amazon.com Inc. announced that the DPA from Luxembourg (CNPD) had fined Amazon Europe Core S.à r.l. EUR 746,000,000 for failing to process personal data in compliance with the GDPR. Amazon plans to take legal action against the decision. The Spanish DPA (AEPD) has imposed a fine on UNIVERSIDAD A DISTANCIA DE MADRID, S.A.. A data subject had filed a complaint against the distance learning university. He stated that he had requested the controller to delete all his data and prohibit its processing for any purpose. He received a confirmation, that his data had been completely deleted. Nevertheless, the data subject later received advertising from the controller by e-mail. The AEPD then imposed a fine of EUR 5,000, which was reduced to EUR 3,000 due to acknowledgement of guilt and immediate payment. The Spanish DPA (AEPD) has fined NEXTSTEPAGENCY, S.L. EUR 1,000. A website of the controller lacked reliable data about the owner of the website such as tax number and postal address.  The Finnish DPA imposed a fine of EUR 25,000 on a higher education institution for data protection violations in the processing of employee location data. The controller had introduced a mobile application that allowed teleworkers to clock in and out. The use of the application on a mobile device also required authorization for location data collection. The collection of location data at the time of clocking in was a feature of the app, without which it was not possible to clock in working hours using the app. According to the information received from the controller, the controller did not actively use or exploit the location data in any situation, but only processed the location data at the time of clocking in for technical reasons. However, the mere fact that time clocking is not possible in the application without processing the location data does not make it necessary to process them. The DPA therefore considered this to be a violation of the lawfulness of the data collection and of the principle of data minimization, since the processing of location data was not necessary for the purpose of the processing - i.e., the mere recording of working hours.  The Italian DPA (Garante) has fined food delivery service Deliveroo Italy s.r.l. EUR 2,500,000 for unlawfully processing the personal data of approximately 8000 drivers. Garante's investigation revealed numerous and serious data protection violations. The violations included a lack of transparency in the algorithms used to manage drivers, both when assigning jobs and when booking work shifts. Deliveroo had used a centralized system for driver management through which it then processed and managed the assignment of orders as well as the booking of work shifts. However, Garante notes that the controller did not adequately inform the drivers about the functioning of the system they had installed on their smartphones, and did not ensure the accuracy and correctness of the results of the algorithmic systems used to evaluate the drivers. In addition, Garante found that Deliveroo carried out a meticulous control of the drivers' work performance - through the continuous geolocation of their device, which went far beyond what was necessary to assign the order (e.g., recording the position every 12 seconds) - and through the storage of a large amount of personal data collected during the execution of the orders, including communication with customer service. In this context, the storage period of the various data had not been defined in a manner appropriate to the purpose. Instead, the controller had defined a flat storage period of six years. Furthermore, the Garante found that the controller had not implemented adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure adequate security of the processing. Deliveroo Italy had also not conducted a data protection impact assessment, although this would have been necessary due to the risk posed to the drivers. The DPA of Lower Saxony has imposed a fine of EUR 65,000 on a company. The reason for the proceedings was a report by the company to the authority regarding a data breach pursuant to Art. 33 GDPR. As a result, the DPA conducted an audit of the company's web presence. In the process, the DPA discovered that an outdated web store application was used on the site, which was no longer provided with security updates. The developer had explicitly warned against further use of this version, as it contained significant security vulnerabilities. The investigations of the DPA further revealed that the passwords stored in the database were not sufficiently secured. The DPA concluded that the technical measures taken by the responsible party were not adequate for the protection requirements of the GDPR, resulting in a violation of Art. 32 GDPR. The Austrian DPA has imposed a fine of EUR 2,000,000 on Rewe affiliate Ö-Bonus Club GmbH. When signing up for the customer loyalty program jö Bonus Club, the controller is said to have failed to properly explain that customers' data and shopping behavior are used to create individual profiles, and that the information is also passed on to partner companies. According to the GDPR, the clarification must be easily accessible and in simple language. However, the controller had designed the registration for the jö Bonus Club in such a way that the clarification about profiling could only be found after scrolling down. However, the consent was placed higher up, so in all cases the consents were obtained before the clarification. In turn, on the physical flyers, the signature box placed at the bottom of the form appeared as if it were a confirmation of enrollment in the club, even though it constituted consent to profiling as well. The DPA concluded that the controller breached its duty to provide consent in an understandable and easily accessible form in clear and simple language. Accordingly, it deemed the consents to be invalid and the profiling carried out on their basis to be unlawful. The Spanish DPA (AEPD) imposed a fine of EUR 2,000 on a private individual. The controller had published the phone number of the data subject to a picture of another person on a dating website in order to create a fake profile with the name 'Katy'. This was only possible due to the fact that no proof of identity was required to create a profile on the portal. The identity of whistleblowers must be protected by special confidentiality rules, as the information processed is particularly sensitive and the risk of retaliation and discrimination in the work environment is high. In this context, the controller is obliged to comply with the principles of data protection and to ensure the integrity and security of the data. Against this background, the Italian DPA (Garante) fined Aeroporto Guglielmo Marconi di Bologna S.p.a. EUR 40,000 and its software supplier EUR 20,000 for violations of the GDPR. In the course of the DPA's investigation, it was found that the application for collecting and managing criminal reports was accessed without the use of a secure network protocol (e.g., the link protocol) and that the application itself did not provide for encryption of the reporting party's identification data, the information about the report and the attached documents. The DPA considered this to be a violation of the obligation to take technical and organizational measures that ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk to the data subjects. In addition, the DPA found that the controller should have conducted an impact assessment, given the sensitivity of the information processed and the risks and vulnerability of the data subjects. The identity of whistleblowers must be protected by special confidentiality rules, as the information processed is particularly sensitive and the risk of retaliation and discrimination in the work environment is high. In this context, the controller is obliged to comply with the principles of data protection and to ensure the integrity and security of the data. Against this background, the Italian Data Protection Authority (Garante) fined Aeroporto Guglielmo Marconi di Bologna S.p.a. EUR 40,000 and its software supplier aiComply S.r.l. EUR 20,000 for violations of the GDPR. In the course of the DPA's investigation, it was found that the application for collecting and managing criminal reports was accessed without the use of a secure network protocol (e.g., the link protocol) and that the application itself did not provide for encryption of the reporting party's identification data, the information about the report and the attached documents. The DPA considered this to be a violation of the obligation to take technical and organizational measures that ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk to the data subjects. In addition, the DPA found that aiComply failed to contractually regulate the relationships with two other companies that processed data on its behalf. The Romanian DPA (ANSPDCP) has fined Actamedica SRL EUR 3,000. The controller had informed a private individual about the loss of her biological samples and a sum of money sent via a courier service. When asked what personal data had been disclosed on this occasion and whether the ANSPDCP had been informed of this incident, the controller only provided the contact details of his lawyer and an e-mail address of the courier service to which the private individual could address her complaint. The ANSPDCP found a breach of the controller's obligation to implement technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk to data subjects, as well as a breach of the controller's obligation to notify the ANSPDCP of the data breach. The Polish DPA (UODO) has imposed a fine of EUR 2,200 on the president of the Zgierz District Court. The president had reported a data breach involving the loss of an unencrypted USB stick by a probation officer. The data medium stored the data of 400 persons under probation supervision. The lost and at the same time unsecured data carrier has not yet been found, so that unauthorized persons could still have access to the personal data it contained. The president had assumed that the duty to secure the data did not lie with himself, but with the respective probation officers who had these data in use. However, the DPA found that the president himself should have secured the USB sticks. \\xa0The Spanish DPA (AEPD) has imposed a fine on Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A.. The reason for this had been a complaint from a person relating to a lack of authentication. Accordingly, only the ID number had to be given as identification when providing information by telephone. This could allow any person to call, provide an ID number, and thus receive the information associated with the ID number without any verification that the caller is actually the ID holder. The DPA considered this to be a failure to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk posed to the data subjects. The original fine of EUR 200,000 was reduced to EUR 120,000 due to voluntary payment and acknowledgement of guilt. The Spanish DPA (AEPD) has imposed a fine on an agency. The controller had disposed of documents containing personal data of its clients in the garbage. The AEPD considered this to be a lack of security and data protection measures in the sense of Art. 32 GDPR, which states that 'the controller and processor shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure an adequate level of security.' The original fine of EUR 3,000 was reduced to EUR 1,800 due to voluntary payment and acknowledgement of guilt. The Spanish DPA (AEPD) has fined Automecanica Jerez, S.L. EUR 4,000. The controller had sent commercial e-mails to a large number of people without their consent. In doing so, the controller failed to hide the personal data of the recipients, such as surname, first name and email address, which allowed the other recipients to view the data. The AEPD considered this to be a violation of Article 5 (1) f) GDPR and Article 32 GDPR, as the controller had failed to implement technical and organizational measures to ensure an adequate level of security in the processing of personal data. Furthermore the AEPD found a breach of Art. 21 LSSI.  The Danish DPA has imposed a fine of EUR 53,800 on Midtjylland Region. On June 12, 2020, the DPA received a notification from the region regarding a personal data security breach pursuant to Art. 33 GDPR. According to the notification, all patients and staff at a lifestyle center were able to access a building where up to 100,000 physical patient records were stored, including health information and personal identity number details. The reason for this was that both staff and patients had been given key cards that allowed them to access all three buildings of the lifestyle center, regardless of whether the user was required to access them. In addition, passersby were able to take a look at the covers of some of the records -which showed personal data such as identity numbers and names - through a window in the building. In this context, the DPA found that the Midtjylland Region had not taken adequate security measures for the storage of personal data. In addition, the region had not established sufficient guidelines for access restrictions when creating key cards, and had not conducted adequate periodic testing, assessment, and evaluation of the security measures taken. In evaluating the question of whether a fine should be imposed, the Danish DPA took into account, as an aggravating factor, that the region processed large amounts of sensitive data, such as health data.  The Italian DPA (Garante) has imposed a fine of EUR 200,000 on the Region of Lombardy. The region had published on its website the personal data of more than 100,000 students who had applied for state scholarships or financial grants for the purchase of textbooks, technical equipment and teaching materials. As the Garante's preliminary audit revealed, it was possible to view and download the list of approved and funded applications, the list of approved and to be funded applications, the list of state scholarship recipients and the list of ineligible applications from the region's website. These lists included personally identifiable information such as the application ID, the applicant's name, the student's grade, the code and name of the school, as well as the application number. In this context, the DPA stated that the data of persons applying for economic benefits must be protected in a special way to prevent the economic and social hardship of the data subjects from becoming evident. The Italian DPA (Garante) has imposed a fine of EUR 800,000 on Roma Capitale. The Garante had launched an investigation following a complaint from an individual who had complained about the new parking meters installed in the city in 2018. In fact, the company Atac s.p.a., which was also contracted by the city to manage the parking lots, had initiated a technical upgrade of the parking meters in order to offer new services (e.g., the payment of fines/fees or the purchase/renewal of public transport tickets) and introduce new payment methods that also take into account the vehicle's license plate number. Part of the equipment was supplied by another company, Flowbird Italia s.r.l. All parking information was then managed through a centralized system, which could also be accessed through an app by the employees responsible for controlling parking fees. Irregularities were then identified during the investigation. Namely, the city of Rome, as data controller, had not provided information on the processing of the drivers' data, had not designated the company Atac as data processor, and had not provided it with the necessary instructions to process the data collected. Also, the subcontractor was not formally instructed nor instructed on how to proceed with the data processing. It was also found that the companies had not established a data processing register. Also, the retention periods for the collected data were not specified, and appropriate security measures were not taken. For example, it was found that at the time of the audit, some data flows to and from the system implemented by Atac were going through insecure channels. In addition, officials could have checked any license plate en masse and repeatedly over time, for example, to find out a person's habits and parking location. In calculating the fine for the unlawful data processing, the DPA aggravatingly took into account the large amount of personal data processed (from June 2018 to November 2019, the system established by Atac had already collected the data of 8,600,000 stops and potentially affects all users of the paid parking service in the city area) and the sanctions already received for data protection violations, but also the positive cooperation offered by the city and the companies to remedy some violations detected during the inspection.  The Italian DPA (Garante) has imposed a fine of EUR 400,000 against Atac s.p.a..

The Cypriot DPA has imposed a fine of EUR 40,000 on the soccer club APOEL FC. Due to a lack of security measures in the club's ticket sales system, it was possible for an unauthorized person to access and disclose personal data of fans on the club's website. This data involved the name, the fan card number and the ID number of the data subjects. The DPA concluded that the club failed to implement adequate technical and organizational security measures. In separate proceedings, the DPA fined AC Omonia and Hellenic Technical Enterprises Ltd. for the same violations. The Cypriot DPA has imposed a fine of EUR 40,000 on the soccer club AC Omonia. Due to a lack of security measures in the club's ticket sales system, it was possible for an unauthorized person to access and disclose personal data of fans on the club's website. This data involved the name, the fan card number and the ID number of the data subjects. The DPA concluded that the club failed to implement adequate technical and organizational security measures. In separate proceedings, the DPA fined APOEL FC and Hellenic Technical Enterprises Ltd. for the same violations. The Cypriot DPA has imposed a fine of EUR 25,000 on Hellenic Technical Enterprises Ltd.. The controller hat designed the ticket sales system of the soccer clubs AC Omonia and APOEL FC. Due to a lack of security measures in the ticket sales system, it was possible for an unauthorized person to access and disclose personal data of fans on the club's website. This data involved the name, the fan card number and the ID number of the data subjects. The DPA concluded that the controller failed to implement adequate technical and organizational security measures. In separate proceedings, the DPA fined APOEL FC and AC Omonia for the same violations. The Danish DPA has imposed a fine of EUR 10,000 on Favrskov municipality. On August 19, 2020, the DPA received a notification from Favrskov Municipality of a personal data breach under Art. 33 GDPR. The notification stated that during a break-in at the municipality's premises, a laptop was stolen which contained a program that provided an overview of the municipality's care facilities and thus information on the names and personal identity numbers of approximately 100 individuals with physical or mental disabilities. The computer hard drive in question was not encrypted and the program in question, which contained confidential and sensitive personal data, was not equipped with security measures. In reviewing the case, the DPO found that Favrskov Municipality had not ensured the encryption of the hard drives of the municipality's laptops for a long period of time prior to August 12, 2020, resulting in an inadequate level of security. The DPA considered this to be a violation of Art. 32 GDPR, as the municipality had failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of protection commensurate with the risk. The Danish DPA imposed a fine of EUR 67,200 on Syddanmark Region. On March 9, 2020, the DPA received a notification from Syddanmark Region regarding a personal data breach according to Art. 33 GDPR. The Syddanmark Region states that since May 2011, a PowerPoint presentation was available on its website that had been created at Odense University Hospital for training purposes and contained charts with personal data - including health information and ID card number details - of 3,915 patients. The region used a screening tool to periodically check for inadvertent postings of personal identity numbers on its website. However, the screening tool was unable to scan the underlying data in PowerPoint presentations. In this context, the DPA found that the region had not implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk. In assessing whether a fine should be imposed, the DPA took into aggravating consideration the fact that Syddanmark Region processes large amounts of personal data, including health data - which is of a sensitive nature.  The Spanish DPA (AEPD) imposed a fine on Vodafone España, S.A.U. for insufficient legal basis for data processing. The data subject stated that two telephone lines were registered in his name, for each of which charges were made. However, the data subject had never concluded contracts with the company for either of these lines. Rather, the contracts in question were concluded by fraudsters using the data subject's personal data. Nevertheless, the personal data was entered into the company's information systems without any verification as to whether the contracts had been lawfully and actually concluded by the data subject. The contracts were concluded even though they were not signed and the information provided by the fraudster, such as the address or date of birth, did not match those on the data subject's ID card. The original fine of EUR 50,000 was reduced to EUR 40,000 due to voluntary payment. The Spanish DPA (AEPD) imposed a fine on Vodafone España, S.A.U. for insufficient legal basis for data processing.The data subject stated that several telephone lines were registered in his name. However, the data subject had never signed contracts with the company for any of these lines. Rather, the contracts in question were concluded by fraudsters using the data subject's personal data. Nevertheless, the personal data was entered into the company's information systems without any verification as to whether the contracts had been lawfully and actually concluded by the data subject. The original fine of EUR 70,000 was reduced to EUR 56,000 due to the voluntary payment. The Spanish DPA (AEPD) imposed a fine on Vodafone España, S.A.U. due to insufficient legal basis for data processing. The data subject stated that, unauthorized third parties had gained access to her Vodafone account and had booked the Vodafone Unlimited package in her name, as well as purchased an iPhone 11 Pro Max in installments. The DPA notes that the controller had not adequately verified whether the contracts had been lawfully and actually concluded by the data subject. The original fine of EUR 70,000 was reduced to EUR 56,000 due to the voluntary payment.  The Norwegian DPA has fined Ferde AS, a Norwegian toll company, EUR 496,000. Through a report on the state-owned broadcasting company NRK, the Norwegian DPA became aware that Ferde AS was transferring information on passages in toll rings to a data processor in China. On this basis, the DPA initiated an investigation into whether Ferde has implemented routines and measures to ensure adequate information security for the information transferred to China. As part of its operations, Ferde is responsible for registering passages at toll booths. The registration is usually done by a chip in the car. If the chip in the car is not properly registered or the car does not have a chip, a photo of the car's license plate is taken. These images are then sent to an automatic optical character recognition system to digitally read the license plate. In cases where the image quality is not good enough for automatic interpretation, the image is transmitted for manual processing. Ferde contracted Unitel Bratseth Services (UBS), which also has employees in China, for this task. After its investigations, the DPA concluded that Ferde AS had violated a number of basic obligations of the GDPR for a period of 1-2 years. For one thing, Ferde had not conducted a risk assessment before processing personal data and before using manual image processing by the processor. However, this would have been necessary to assess the risks associated with the transfer and to determine whether further security measures may be required. In addition, the DPA found that Ferde had not entered into a proper processor contract regarding the processing of UBS.As a result, the transfer of the personal data in question to China took place without a valid legal basis. In determining the amount of the fine, the DPA took into account the aggravating factor that a large amount of personal data was affected by the violation. On the other hand, the fact that no material or immaterial damage to the affected parties could be proven had a mitigating effect.  The Spanish DPA (AEPD) imposed a fine on Vodafone España, S.A.U. due to insufficient legal basis for data processing. The data subject stated that unauthorized third parties gained access to his Vodafone account and signed three mobile phone contracts in his name. The DPA found that Vodafone had failed to verify whether the contracts were lawful and actually concluded by the data subject. The contracts were concluded even though they were not signed and the information provided by the fraudster, such as address or date of birth, did not match those of the data subject. The original fine of EUR 70,000 was reduced to EUR 56,000 due to the voluntary payment.  The Spanish DPA (AEPD) imposed a fine on Vodafone España, S.A.U. for insufficient legal basis for data processing. The data subject stated that he received a call from Vodafone in which the latter requested him to pay for three telephone lines. In the call, he explained to Vodafone that the said lines had neither been ordered nor authorized by him, so he asked to send him the invoices. On the invoices, the data subject recognized that the telephone and account numbers did not match its own.During its investigation, the DPA found that an unauthorized third party had concluded the contracts for the lines in the name of the data subject. In addition, the DPA found that Vodafone failed to verify the identity of the person who concluded the contract and to take the necessary precautions to ensure that these incidents do not occur. The original fine of EUR 70,000 was reduced to EUR 56,000 due to voluntary payment.\""
